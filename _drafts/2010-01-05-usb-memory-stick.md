Let&#8217;s do some basic algebra. <!--more-->X squared. One thing, multiplied by another means that the letter gives birth to a tiny two. Multiply the tiny two until you&#8217;ve reached a conclusion about its legitimacy as a member of the number society. That two is really small right? Well yeah but nowhere near as repulsively small as some.

Go and grab it. I don&#8217;t mean the nearest set of genitals. Grab that little stick that you treat like shit. You stick it in and out of any of the holes in your computer. The little slut of a USB stick. How did it come to this.

One day the number council was introduced to a set of numbers to be used in a supposedly prestigous memory device. Back then computers had one USB port, generally proudly shown off by the computer retailer. The memory device had small numbers; only about 16 megabytes. Not too bad. With that much memory one had to consider what was most important to carry around. As time went on the memory stick got greedy. It started to cram more numbers in.

The power went to its head and it tried to convince the retailers to add more ports to their computers. Eventually the inevitable happened. The number council rejected the memory stick for having so many tiny numbers in such a small space. No respect.

Today, USB sticks are abused, fat whores. Disgustingly common pieces of machinery, packed full with data no one has to even think about because space isn&#8217;t an issue. You stick them in and out of any computer you want. They contract viruses (STIs) and end up broken and useless, a relic of something once beautiful.
