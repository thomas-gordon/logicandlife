The number five, while odd in shape and definition<!--more--> is a sign that represents the way music is written and played on a broad scale. There are 60 seconds in every minute. You can divide sixty into a bunch of little fives. There are five lines on a music chart. Then if you think about it the conventional speed of comtemporary music is 120BPM, so two beats for every second. 

We like it because it means that time seems to go twice as fast, it&#8217;s an escapist mechanism for coping. Metalheads like faster speeds that literally raise your blood pressure, your body struggling to stay in the reality of a second while the senses are bombarded with a sonic assault that triples or quadriples our perception. So in musical notation the notes rest on these lines and define what the music sounds like. For each of the five lines, a metaphor for our own five senses is held.

It follows that to experience the ultimate form of music, one with either new notes or one with less one should remove a line in the notation. This is why Mozart stuck a stake in both ears and hammered it in to his ear drums. Being deaf and having an awareness of two levels of musical awareness meant he could write some of the best music that you can hear. In the movie &#8220;the sixth sense&#8221; the real twist of it is that the soundtrack sounds terrible to the average ear.. but then if you try and imagine what operating on another plane of notes&#8230; it might be ok! &#8220;I see dead people and I also hear music differently&#8221; would have been a much better tag-line for the film.
