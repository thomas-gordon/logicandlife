While whales share some of their name with the word &#8220;while&#8221;, they&#8217;re quite busy being in space. <!--more--> The logic behind this is basic. Whales are big and space is the only place big enough to hold them. No wonder they&#8217;re so saught after in Japan. Does japan even have a space program? If not they should get on it. Talk about your rare delicacies!
