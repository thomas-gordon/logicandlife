Drains, we&#8217;re all sick and tired of you feeling unwell. <!--more-->Every day I go past the drain near my house it&#8217;s sick. Instead of gulping down fresh uncontaminated water that has been on the street and flown through many a bag&#8217;o&#8217;trash&#8230; it&#8217;s vomiting. Vomiting all of that crap back up. If you can&#8217;t do your freaking job because you&#8217;re sick then don&#8217;t come to work! If you go into the city on a really wet day, you see them everywhere. These ill drains spewing shit everywhere, doing the exact opposite of what they&#8217;re meant to. I searched google for &#8220;drains&#8221; and one of the top results was a company whose job it was to unblock them. I&#8217;m petitioning for the reversal of drains. If drains were made to spew crap 

*outward*, the sick ones would *suck* it all in! Much better.
