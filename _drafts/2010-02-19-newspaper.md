I haven&#8217;t dealt with a lot of conspiracy theories on here. <!--more-->Largely because they are not fact and therefore cannot be backed up with any real evidence. Today i&#8217;d like to discuss one that actually has logical weight. Paper is dead. Has been for years. Computers have superceded the form in almost every case. Instead of printing out an A4 document for your teacher to mark you just eye laser it into their brains. (this also explains why teachers are real smart, they have all the knowledge in their headz)

When I&#8217;m walking around an e-zine shop there&#8217;s only one relic of this tree-wasting, environment shitting-on relic and that&#8217;s the &#8220;newspaper&#8221;. So why does it still exist. It exists to present you something that you can&#8217;t read. Let me explain: the newspaper has a lot of news. It also has a lot of words that aren&#8217;t news like world news, business and finance and comics. It also has pictures but unfortunately the thing has more words than pictures even though clearly a picture can tell a thousand words and if that were the case you wouldn&#8217;t need to waste money on hiring editors.

It&#8217;s full of shit so you won&#8217;t read it, so you won&#8217;t get all sad at how shit the world is. It&#8217;s full of news so you don&#8217;t care about the news. We have government worrying nowadays that news aggregators like RSS present us with a limited scope for democracy. Well that might be the case if we were mice, attempting to chase the cheese and learning it&#8217;s only in one direction. The government want you to read the paper so you won&#8217;t care about what they&#8217;re doing. Kind of like stuffing a chimp&#8217;s head inside a coin purse. You want it to get in there but it&#8217;s all hairy and spits in your face.
