Oh this tastes so good. <!--more-->It tastes so good that before I eat it I&#8217;m going to lick my fingers, pick up my knife and fork and then eat and when I&#8217;m done I&#8217;m going to put down my utensils and lick all of my fingers again, this time more thoroughly. The understanding and practice of STIs, or &#8220;secondary taste intent&#8221; is very weird. At a base level the mouth is always tasting things. If you think about it real hard you can taste your saliva, hell the old monks down on the farm used to be proponents of tasting their own tongues for sustenance.

The idea is that if you lick all the germs off your fingers before eating you protect the food from being covered in them and getting ill. The licking after the meal has completed allows you to clean all the germs off your fingers you got on there while getting covered in grease. So importantly; how does this all relate to licking your fingers before turning the page in a book&#8230; even performing sexual acts with your hand?

Well the thing is that the normal thing for a human to do when seriously hungry is eat your hand. You with eat with your hands if you have no cutlery or chopsticks, so you probably would eat your hands if you were hungry enough. So no wonder we love the taste of our fingers. That and I think on some level we like to eat our own shit, especially if you&#8217;re up yourself. Smell your hands RIGHT NOW. Smell like shit? You love it.
