Outside on the porch the other day I came to a couple of realisations.<!--more--> First that the surrounding heat melted my ice cream, meaning my hands were &#8220;in the goo&#8221; of sugary pasteness that replaces a frozen, solid ice cream. Second I compared birds to trees. I started to wonder if there were any trees with more birds than leaves. If this the case then why aren&#8217;t there more trees that ARE birds. This way there would be more birds that wouldn&#8217;t go hungry owing to there being heaps of &#8220;tree birds&#8221; all around. Normal birds can feed on the bird sap from the bird tree&#8217;s sack. So then this train of thought started to traverse into how things are relative to each other. How our relatives are called relatives only because they&#8217;re relatively like you genetically.

Then I thought &#8220;general relativity&#8221; must be more complex than this. I read some books like Treasure Island and all of those Dickens and came back with a scientific proof for relativity. Plants and animals are relative to their surrounds. When they become too big for their boots, they get turned into something else. What this summises is that trees were once something else that got too annoying and loud and environment wreck-y got turned into a tree. Similar to how birds were once fish and they got relatively too big for their boots and got given wings so they were birds. Eventually I have no doubt that birds everywhere, owing to their general proclivity will soon turn into legbigards, birdlike mammoths with feet, tiny wings to mark the fact they can&#8217;t fly and can&#8217;t sqwark.

Moving onto humans, I would have thought our time came ages ago but perhaps not. This is because we invented words. In other words to most creatures turning into a less annoying thing is an unfortunate part of life. But with humans, we just give these things new names. Like how we used to call sparrows &#8220;emus&#8221; because they looked different but then the tiny neck birds were punished for being annoying and have tiny necks and then were given large necks, turning into giraffes and then finally emus. No living thing on this earth wants to be born an emu.
