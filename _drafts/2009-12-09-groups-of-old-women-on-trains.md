Always sitting in six packs, <!--more-->these sets of middle-aged to old women meet to discuss trains and where they’re going to get off. No one quite understands what they’re saying because they’re listening to their iPods. If you have a pack of cards, yell “fish!” at them because YOU’RE HOLDING ALL THE PAIRS.
