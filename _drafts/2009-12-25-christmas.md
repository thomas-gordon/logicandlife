I&#8217;ve got some serious news for you guys. <!--more-->I really mean it this time. Christmas has gone too far. I used to think that the &#8220;holiday&#8221; of Christmas was a really simple. A family get together. A time for forgiveness, repentence and if you&#8217;re so inclined, faith. Through my (as always) exhaustive research I have discovered that Christmas is explained in one of two ways.

# 1.

Of all the holidays that exist, the concept of Christmas is realistically the most violent. I want you to do something for me. Get a santa hat, a christmas tree, a north pole and something else christmassy&#8230; oh let&#8217;s say an icicle. Now draw them on your screen in permanent marker. Look:

Tell me what springs to mind. Is it happy thoughts? Is it good times? Or is it&#8230; brutality, death and uncontrollable anger. All of these objects are either shaped like knives or actually&#8230; ARE knives. If we peeled off the drawing you made on your screen to reveal the underlying truth you would indeed see knives. Look.

Now why would santa hide knives inside things? If he wanted everyone dead couldn&#8217;t he just kill them? Well here&#8217;s the kicker guys, santa is so twisted that he wants to use the subconscious to destroy us. Why is it that people come together at Christmas and not at any other time of the year. If it&#8217;s such a despised activity why waste our time AT ALL? We do it because the Christmas objects invoke a sense of anger and the only way we can cope is by having lots and lots of people around to listen to our anger, take it in and then get wasted and throw our selves into depression for the the rest of the day. As well as this, santa realises that the majority of people don&#8217;t have a family at all. By highlighting the event in such a subtle yet violent way he makes **more** people sad than he does happy. Mission Accomplished.

I want you to think about the last time you got REALLY freaking smashed. I don&#8217;t care what your poison is. Was it alcohol? Maybe marijuana, maybe acid, coke, speed ecstasy bla bla yes they&#8217;re drugs I know hey! In some respect.. the last time you were high. Hell I don&#8217;t care if you were &#8220;high on life&#8221; as long as your perception was altered significantly. Frankly that&#8217;s the only way the Christmas story could have come into existence.  Just how else would all these disparate objects have come together to form a final complete, supposedly logical explanation for the event? The story goes like this:

*A friend comes to your party which you&#8217;re holding at a little hotel in the US. It&#8217;s one of the last nights of the year, might as well get destroyed a few days before new years so you have time to recover in order to do it all again. The friend offers you hard drugs <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">(presents)</span>, to be taken only under the condition of consuming 1 litre of vodka in the space of one hour. It&#8217;s freezing outside, snowing, so you decide to warm up the room by turning on the television to watch some **hotel porn** <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">(anagram for north pole)</span>. After you&#8217;ve finished you&#8217;re well and truly feeling the effects of all the poisons running through your veins. Suddenly you realise that you are by far the tallest person in the room. The room is spinning but look at these tiny people all around you! The rest of the people there are insignificant <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">elves</span> in the scheme of life. You reach a drug induced epiphany that nothing else matters except right then and there. Then you vomit on a man who seems to come from nowhere.</p> 

The drugs flip your perception to see the dude as huge. He is actually quite big. Wearing **green** and having a Gothic attitude, the dude looks messed up in your current state. He&#8217;s covered in Gothic needles, metal spikes and wreaks of car freshener for some reason. <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">(tree)</span> Then you vomit. All over him. The food lights up his dark green clothing. Orange carrot, red tomato sauce and finally to top it all off then an undigested  ecstasy pill with a star printed on it comes out and lands in his hair. <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">(tree decorations)</span> The dude gets mad. You run away, freaked out of your mind. You trip. Fall on the hard concrete, frozen in the winter weather. The next thing you know there&#8217;s a red and white light. The lights are flashing and you&#8217;re being lifted into an ambulance. In between noticing the lights and the colors red, white, red, white all around you hear the nurse who is with you exclaim

&#8220;Hurry up RAINN <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">(rein-)</span>! This kid is seriously fucked up!&#8221; the old looking driver replies

&#8220;Ok Dear <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">(-deer)</span>, we&#8217;ll get him there in time, don&#8217;t worry. Jesus the kid is lucky we could pick him up&#8230; shit look!&#8221;

You feel violently ill. The nurse calls out &#8220;do you have any <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">talcs</span>? This kid is all soaked, he could get a death of cold. &#8221;

&#8220;yeah I&#8217;ve got some in the back. Grab them&#8230; but wouldn&#8217;t the kid be feeling&#8230; &#8221;

you vomit again and the driver finishes his sentence : &#8220;<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">nausea</span>?&#8221; <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">(anagram for nausea talcs = santa clause)</span></em>

Naturally the next day you wake up and all you remember is that santa clause took you away all covered in red and white. You vomited on a big tree and the decorations were beautiful. The north pole made you feel all warm and fuzzy and you got some presents from a friend. And what was with those elves? Rather simple isn&#8217;t it?
