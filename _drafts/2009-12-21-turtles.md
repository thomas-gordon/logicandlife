&#8220;Yeah sure I&#8217;ll shell out a few bucks for it&#8221; <!--more-->How many times have you heard someone say THAT. You&#8217;re sitting around amusing yourself with a piece of paper and some cherries and suddenly you&#8217;re stuck with having to offer whatever little money you have to some bullshit cause. Well of course I&#8217;ll add my money but what&#8217;s the cause? Well no matter what the colloquial bloke tells you the money is for, he&#8217;s lying. Why do you think that Australia is the only place people use this blatantly sick saying. There is no mafia, there is no underworld, there is no crime except turtles.

Turtles accidentally let the phrase &#8220;shell out for us&#8221; slip in an undercover operation where they were trying to get money out of a lowly bogan named &#8220;Derrick&#8221;. Derrick paid the turtles in full and then when he needed money he asked others to &#8220;shell out&#8221; so he could continue to live. In fact this is the only insight we have into the vast and perpetual turtle empire. If someone comes to your door over Christmas asking you to just &#8220;shell out&#8221; for the poor, the homeless, the dead or the bugs, just remember all you&#8217;re doing is funding some bastard turtle&#8217;s rock sunbathing empire.
