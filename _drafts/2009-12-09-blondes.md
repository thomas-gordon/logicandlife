There is a saying <!--more-->that “blondes” have all the fun, mostly in reference to women with long blonde hair.  This traces back to the invention of the lion. The mane of the male lion is resplendent in blonde and cascades gracefully from its neck. The female lionesses plotted one day to steal the mane from their male counterparts. They took to skinning their mates, taking the mane sticking the manes to themselves with sticky tape while leaving the men dead and rotting for hyenas. Over millennia the manes became permanently glued to the females and they were eventually referred to as the males. Check a “lioness’s genitals at the zoo and you will find they have a penis!
