Sodomy and cheese are more related that you&#8217;d think. <!--more-->Back in the day cheese was simple. Dairy, whipped like butter and mixed with pieces of the sun to make it yellow. The brilliance of the sun pieces gave the cheese a flavour not unlike wafers. The question as yet answered is how it all went so horribly wrong. Ever heard your great-great-grandmother exclaim &#8220;Jesus christ that soap smells like the shit from an alcoholic&#8217;s ass!&#8221; It&#8217;s something we all have to go through. The thing is&#8230; where was I? Oh yes. One day some really, really horny dude who never washed had sex with a block of cheese.

The stench of his overall being was forced into the cheese and many of the molecules retracted in horror to his rather threatening male parts and again, the stench. Was the inventor of sodomy swiss? No, don&#8217;t be awful. But swiss cheese was invented in switzerland. Sodomy has spread to many other cheeses. Think about THAT when you bite into your next delicious, fresh crispy subway roll (and they&#8217;re so low in fat as well! I think I&#8217;m going to go eat one right now).
