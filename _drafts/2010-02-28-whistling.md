Mount Whistler is one of the biggest mountains in the world. <!--more-->Its towering peaks roam above the wild wilderness of West Africa. Birds fly up to the top and sit on it, observing the world as a child can before they put on their skies and snow goggles and ride down back to their eggs. It gets cold in winter and at night the trees tower like they have shadows.  Then from deep in a dark cavern at the bottom of cave a noise erupts like the pitch from the shattering of a blackboard against the cacophonous lightning filled sky.

A hell-scream, adapted by the human being to bring the earth to its knees. Let&#8217;s do some basic calculation. Humans were around when there were dinosaurs. Now while the dinosaur is very stupid we&#8217;ve seen evidenced in movies like &#8220;Jurassic Park&#8221; that the things really have dominion over our weak, stupid selves.

So it begs the question &#8220;Why is it that humans are the dominant species on the planet?&#8221; Clearly the dinosaur and a whole lot of other whale-like fish are just built a lot better than our weak, disease ridden corpses. It&#8217;s down to &#8220;cavemen&#8221;. Yes we all used to live in caves, bearing witness to our own intelligence by carving a hole in the side of Mount Whistler. There some wind rushed through the passages and it made &#8220;nature&#8217;s call&#8221;, the whistle. Outside all the dinosaurs would come and stand around, helpless to the call of the wind. So like all things men just fuckin&#8217; nicked it and copied it. Suddenly the dinosaurs were doing all the dishes, cleaning all the caves of graffiti and taking out the garbage&#8230; into their mouths.

So we apply this blatant rip off of nature to the broader community. Simply speaking those who can whistle can tell other people what to do. In the most basic of cases it&#8217;ll get people&#8217;s attention. Whoever has the best whistle gets the most sex, the most money and the most power. When Caesar whistled not only did he make a delicious salad, all the toughest warriors&#8217; erections fell limp at the power of the man. If you haven&#8217;t learnt, get on it. Life skillz.
