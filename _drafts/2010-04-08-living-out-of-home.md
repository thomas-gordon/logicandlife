First off the bat the phrase is a bit misleading. <!--more-->Unless you live with no shelter you don&#8217;t exactly &#8220;live out of home&#8221; and if you&#8217;re homeless the phrase doesn&#8217;t evn get passed around. Not even as a peace pipe around a fire. Out of interest was that shit they smoked marijuana?

So the way living out of home works revolves around spending. At first it seems endlessly appealing because you find a good place with ncie cheap rent. Ohhhh $80 a week? What a bargain! Right now I&#8217;m easily earning at least $120 a week! How much are bills? $11 a week? Shit that&#8217;s awesome!

So off you go to the new digs and you&#8217;re all set up and it&#8217;s fine and dandy. Then you realise that you can&#8217;t eat gas unless you count your own and you can&#8217;t use toilet paper unless it&#8217;s your clothing, in which case you have to pay more for the water bill to clean the crisp shirts you ruined.

The problem can be described with maths. Let&#8217;s start at the bottom and work up with a weekly expenditure.

  1. $80 Rent
  2. $800 Travel Expenses
  3. $8000 Income
  4. $80000 Alocohol
  5. $800000 Vegetables
  6. $8000000 Fridge Repair

Ok so the last one seems unreasonable but for the most part the fridge is always, always broken. There is as always a solution. It&#8217;s called what we in the industry refer to as an &#8220;inverse pyramid&#8221;

  1. $80 Tents
  2. $1600 Unravelled Expenses
  3. $8000 And-cuming (for stress relief)
  4. $80000 Ill-ocohol
  5. $800000 Vege-tables (saves on buying and replacing furniture
  6. $8000000 Bridge eating pears

It&#8217;s quite simple. If you spend correctly then you&#8217;ll always have enough money. Tents are cheaper than rent, by unravelling your expenses they double, have more sex so you forget about money, convince yourself that drinking anything at all will make you sick and then get a government blackmail pay out because the hegemonic control of alcohol production and consumption is ruined, make your furniture out of the weekly groceries and then sit on a bridge and eat very, very, very expensive pears with the money you&#8217;ve saved.
