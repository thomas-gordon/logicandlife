Ah the Swiss.<!--more--> Providers of all the dairy needs for the world. They pump out over 40 billion tonnes of cheese every year across their expansive network of 100 dairy farms. The way they do it is clear, they just skimp on the cheese, giving it its characteristic holes. The question that remains to me is how do they actually rid the dairy-goodness of the holes? I had a massive think about this. There needs to be a way that you can give a computer enough intelligence to dig holes in cheese that seem utterly random. Aside from this, how would one make a hole in cheese without first breaking it open?

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> tells me that pacman was invented on the 22nd of May, 1980. When was swiss cheese taken to levels of production beyond the seemingly possible? A month later. The correlation is fascinating. Some japanese dudes were sitting around a table eating this solid slab of cheese and realised that they had an opportunity to advance their brand and the cheese brand. Give them both a sense of individuality. So they drew up level plans that varied on a random scale and lay them on top of the cheese making process.

Depending on the order of a pacman eating the dots, or &#8220;holes of cheese&#8221;, holes are generated with these variables of varying size and location within the physical block of cheese on the production line in sweden. Since so many millions of people played pacman, collecting the amount of data needed was a simple task. To this day the mundane game remains immensely popular. Why is this? Because it HAS to be popular to keep up with the daily requirements for worldwide cheese production.
