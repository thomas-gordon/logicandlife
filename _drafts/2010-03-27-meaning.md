I struggled with this word. <!--more-->I struggled with getting up this morning. I struggled with wearing pants as my housemates and &#8230; everyone I know are so painfully aware. I have an ugly, ugly scrotum, one that is accentuated by my terrible choice in underwear. So why does one continue to struggle? In fact.. why do two continue to struggle? Why do we all continue to struggle against the tide of the willing, the tide of the self-actualization drive that underpins every single human on the planet? The answer lies in the inverting of humanity from dead to alive. The world used to be dead. In fact all of the dirt, all of the animals, trees and humans used to be dead. One day a massive gust of wind erupted from the earth&#8217;s crust in such a way that conflicted with hell. Everything was in hell you see. The trees were in hell because they were always falling on people and killing them and the animals were in hell because well&#8230; have you ever seen horse porn? Something&#8217;s got to be wrong about that. Something about the way the horse is so erect.

So this massive gust of wind matched precisely the opposite of the world spinning. As such the earth went backwards in time. The evidence is shown in how the human breathes in before breathing out. Originally it was out before in. Humans were dragged out of hell one by one until there was two human lives present on the earth. Just two. I won&#8217;t say if it they were both female or male but I will say that when they came into existence they proceeded to resurrect the rest of the earth. Why? Because they got fucking bored. Bored out of their skulls. They tried having sex but only occasionally made anything and they&#8217;d generally just eat the foetus as there was no food.

So with nothing to do on the barren wasteland of the world they decided they had to scavenge to create a new world full of opportunity. One of them would shit. I mean shit for a very long time. You know when you shit and you feel utterly empty? Well they got onto that. The first thing they sculpted out of the shit was a tree because they were running out of oxygen. It was easy really. Just leave your shit to harden and then give it life by giving it mouth to mouth. Â The tree flourished until it could drop seeds and grow more trees. The humans were ecstatic! They continued to shit and create any number of things. Dodos, blue footed boobies and vaginas (quickly became extinct as they had no way to breathe). All the animals in the world. Eventually the humans could eat their own shit-laden creations and sustain creating the easier thing&#8230; another human.

So what does this all mean? It means that the meaning of life is to create things. Relationships, work and general existence are always moving towards this. Because of social convention religeon was invented to give an excuse for rapid expansion that seemed beyond reason The problem nowadays is that our instinct to expand is unsustainable. Recently a baby was born who breathed out before it breathed in. Thus the cycle will continue until time reverses and we end up first primitive wiuthout anything except ourselves and then all dead, waiting the next accidental volcanic eruption of air to turn the tides once again and have us shitting fountains once again. Loose ends? Oh yeah how did we shit so much if there was no food? Think about this: if you shit all the time do you have any food in you? I think not. You&#8217;re void but you&#8217;ll still go to the toilet. Bound to happen.
