As a frequent cocaine user<!--more-->,

![][1] one who well&#8230; where was I? Oh yeah I&#8217;m flying high at the moment. I&#8217;ve got about 10 lines in me and I didn&#8217;t even eat anything today. Hence my lovely imaciated form. I love reflections and I love mirrors. In fact it&#8217;s a bit of a love-fest in my head at the moment. There&#8217;s also some kind of story playing out in my head about the best way to micro manage SME executives into firing themselves from their jobs. Now well may I rabbit on in a drugged up fashion there is no rest for the wicked. In here it is we find the latest thing to grace humanity&#8217;s glorious, flawless existence; the ipad. No, that&#8217;s right spell-checker, I did mean that word.

You&#8217;ve just bought it. It&#8217;s a big, black thingy with a touch screen (isn&#8217;t everything?). Apparently it&#8217;s a computer but it&#8217;s about to get you with the thing that all these uber sheek products contain, and that is animals. I don&#8217;t mean that they *are* animals, simply that they contain within them the remainder of animals. Humans love animals so if we see something that has them involved in the production we goo and ga. So let&#8217;s think about this. What is shiny? Kittens paws, fresh from the womb of the mother cat.

The pads from the bottom of their feet are smooshed up into a clear paste and coat the ipad itself. In fact without this kitten sheen the product wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;cool&#8221; at all. Actually look at someone using the thing. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re giving it a continual hand-job but the screen never gives way to cummy goodness. The reflection in it is one of post-modern sexual frustration and the lack of bestiality permeating our existence. We need to do something about this.
