Nuggets of wisdom. Nuggets of gold. <!--more-->Because the same word is used for two completely separate meanings in reality they must they equate to the same thing! Let me explain myself master/montasaur. If we were to switch the meanings around, the word would still be &#8220;nugget&#8221;. This allows the word to be made infinitely useful. Why? Well switch the definitions and suddenly you can 

**dig up** nuggets of wisdom and **learn** nuggets of gold! Sitting in your classroom you could vomit up chunks of gold while the teacher takes you through Maths or Science history lessons read from the bible.

Taking it further, it seems that alchemists would benefit from the removal of the &#8220;piece of knowledge&#8221; meaning of &#8220;nugget&#8221;. If nugget could *ONLY* refer to a large chunk of gold then if someone said &#8220;There&#8217;s a useful nugget of info for ya&#8221; after finishing a crappy story instead of feeling that you had learnt something you would produce gold, smelt it down into into a large gold bat and hit this guy who never shuts up with his crappy stories over the top of the head with it. Seriously if anyone ever says nugget in reference to knowledge to me they will pay dearly. In gold pieces. Or Nuggets.
