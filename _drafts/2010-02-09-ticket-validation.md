To feel that you are achieving life&#8217;s goals.<!--more--> To have that list even within your grasp is worth discussing. Then along came those lousy ticket advanced ticket booths and ruined it all. They ruined it all on such a base, sexual level. Back in prep I remember having to validate for the first time.

This was an experience of normality. One simply had to shake the conductors hand and then give him your ticket all secret-like. He&#8217;d take it from you and in return give you a new hole which you didn&#8217;t have before. Simple sexual gratification. You&#8217;d go up the back of the bus, feeling sexually relieved and have a big cigarette as they do in the movies.

There was nothing perverted about it, it was so just&#8230; validating! Nowadays it&#8217;s an ugly, more often than not painful experience. As a man, I can only describe one side of it but maybe you&#8217;d like to imagine your own reactions if you&#8217;re a woman. So you have to buy your sex from the machine. It coldly dispenses your permission for pleasure&#8230; if you could call it that. Then comes the painful steps. The following apply

*For the metcard (the metcard is a cardboard ticket):*

  * Show your ticket to the time on the front of the machine.
  * Now take out your penis and flatten it with a hammer.
  * Puncture your penis with a hole punch so the machine can register the pleasure by grabbing onto the hole.
  * Put penis in and have it laser you and tug harder than you ever thought anything could tug until it releases you and allows you passage on the transport means of your choice.

</p>

  * Make your penis really, really greasy and soggy with &#8230; olive oil.
  * Take out the penis at the card scanner of your choice and just wipe it all over that.
  * Wait until the card scanner rolls over to sleep because she&#8217;s bored of sex and well there&#8217;s no lube and it&#8217;s all dry anyway.
  * Get on board!
