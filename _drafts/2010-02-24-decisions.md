Faced with this blog you have only one option and you&#8217;ve clearly already selected it.Â <!--more-->You&#8217;re reading everything here. In this post, in all of the other posts. Even if you&#8217;ve read it before you&#8217;re doing it again. It is here we find the route of all human decision making. All it is is how convincing you are at lying to another person to get them to do something. In almost every case of decision making there is a lie involved. Assume you&#8217;re an indecisive person, pure of heart but if someone throws you a choice you stick your head in the sand so deep that some one asks you if your ass is your face.

If this sounds like you, congratulations! You haven&#8217;t sunk as low as most of us. Maybe I&#8217;m not being clear. Here&#8217;s an example of a discussion with a completely indecisive person, showing how much someone has to lie to get them off the fence.

*&#8220;Hey do you want to go to the zoo?&#8221; &#8230; *

*&#8220;Maybe.&#8221; &#8230; *

*&#8220;Come on it&#8217;ll be good, it&#8217;ll be so good you&#8217;ll cream!&#8221; *

*&#8220;Do I want cream?&#8221; *

*&#8220;Yes you love dairy&#8221; *

*&#8220;&#8230; yeah maybe&#8221;. *

The zoo is shit and shouldn&#8217;t be considered. As for cream, it&#8217;s not something that you can &#8220;love&#8221;. You can like it but can you *love *it? The thing is if you&#8217;re incapable of making decisions then you&#8217;re also incapable of lying to others about your opinion on something which serves makes you a better person still.

Despite their clearly strong intention of not making any decisions these people are derided, outcast by our society simply because they don&#8217;t get anything done. I am certain that if everyone was indecisive we&#8217;d all get more done because instead of making decisions based around hyperbole and reason we&#8217;d just kind of do them out of absolute necessity. To use another example of an indecisive person: &#8220;Should I go to the toilet?&#8221; Well no you shouldn&#8217;t because it would waste time and is full of effort. So you don&#8217;t. Then only when you absolutely need to go you do. You go standing up on the train. While causing discomfort it actually saves time because you&#8217;re doing something else at the same time. So to be indecisive is to hold all the answers. Try it for a week. Or don&#8217;t. Maybe you should though.
