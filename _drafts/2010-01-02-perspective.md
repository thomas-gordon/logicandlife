Stare really hard at the nearest planet. <!--more-->Where has it gone? You look for a long time but now you&#8217;ve lost it. Someone comes up to you and asks what you&#8217;re looking for. You say &#8220;ganemede&#8221;, one of the moons of pluto. Normally about the size of a 5 cent piece in the sky, it seems to have disappeared. Then you see your friend eating ganymede. What?

&#8220;I was looking at that! Why would you eat it <img src="http://www.logicandlife.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> &#8221;

Suddenly from his perspective he&#8217;s eating a delicious planet and you&#8217;re stuck without your sights to see. This is at the core of perspective. People see things differently and maybe someone eats what you were percieving. It&#8217;s just like the saying &#8220;you say tomato, I say tomata&#8221;. He says tomato, then the other guy eats the &#8220;O&#8221; and vomits an &#8220;A&#8221; and adds it to the end of the word. Several things in the world have been helped by the invention of perspective. At the federation of the states of Australia in 1905, there was a huge hall full of people watching the document being read by Bob Hawke. There was a drawing of australia that looked like this:

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-465" title="australia" src="http://www.logicandlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/australia.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="399" /> 

He finished reading it out and someone ate his head. The blood from his neck spilled onto the parchment and the ink was all messed up. Some drunk redid the lines and now we&#8217;re all fucked because Perth has more landmass than us. If it had perspective it would eat all the other states until Perth was the name of the country. Don&#8217;t abuse perspective, treat it with respect and we&#8217;ll all get fed well.
