As humans we are compelled to comment on everything we see and do. <!--more-->It seems of the utmost importance to describe the weather and other banalities when clearly everyone knows the score already. The fact is the things we have in common are freaking boring. All the things that they tell you at school about being able to get along with everyone; that we&#8217;re all &#8220;connected&#8221;&#8230;we&#8217;re connected on the same level as a cow is to a paddock. The cow and the paddock are way better though, at least they know each other so well that you never hear them talk&#8230; because there&#8217;s NOTHING TO SAY.

So relationships can&#8217;t realistically concern constant banality. You can understand the &#8220;drama queen&#8221; argument on this level. Some women like drama in their relationship so much that they lie and exaggerate for a &#8220;domino effect&#8221; among their friends. Oh and men do it differently but most of the time a LOT stupider. A man would attempt to bring drama into his relationship by calling a Â party clown and having him scare the shit out of the other &#8220;party&#8221; in the relationship. The fact is that there are two ways to get through a one on one relationship with another person for any extended period of time:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MONEY VS. DRAMA.</strong></span>

In the first case we have mark and jasmine. Mark shifts between women and man all the time, he can&#8217;t stay put because he gets bored. Jasmine has worked this out so uses all her money to keep it interesting.

  1. &#8220;Hey mark look a plane that&#8217;s sky writing your name!!!&#8221;
  2. &#8220;Hey mark look that horse is covered in your name, I had a cowboy brand the SHIT out of that animal.&#8221;
  3. &#8220;Hey mark i am now a woman!&#8221;

Well Mark stays around for a while but in the end leaves because he doesn&#8217;t get off on the whole transvestite thing.

In the second case there&#8217;s Gimli and Tracey, an oddly matched pair. Gimli is quiet, happy to comb his beard and sharpen his axe for war. For tracey the world is too big for one relationship; to be tied down to the banalities of knowing someone &#8220;too well&#8221;.

Gimli attempts:

  1. &#8220;Tracey, I just slept with six other women. Shall we fight about that?&#8221;
  2. &#8220;Tracey I just threw out all of your clothing and shat in your christmas cake, can we fight about that?
  3. &#8220;Tracey, I love you but if you don&#8217;t stop being such a cunt I might have to leave you. Can we fight?

Notice how Gimli doesn&#8217;t MEAN it. Like a little wimp at the end he always asks permission for the fight. This is ironically what pisses off tracey the most and therefore is the core souce of drama. It gets Gimli some in the long run. Notice that there was no money exchanged, purely WORDS. Sure Gimli snapped and murdered her with his axe but it was still a healthy partnership up to that point!

This in essence solves the master debate about relationships. If you get bored, PICK A FIGHT. It&#8217;s far cheaper than pussy-ass flowers or writing a sonnet with the local symphony orchestra. Just tell him/her a sentence starting with:

&#8220;I hate it when you..&#8221; or &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we ever&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;You never pay attention&#8230;.&#8221; I could go on. Point is no relationship is perfect but no relationship can last without each person picking fights and exponging exaggerated hate to the other person.
