Ice cream loaves: <!--more-->Can be purchased directly from your local bakery but taste better fresh out of the oven at home. Simply take ice cream out of the freezer and scoop into a bread tin and cook in oven for 45min- 1 hour. Careful when it comes out, the crust will be quite hard to cut through! Delicious with a glass of salmonella.
