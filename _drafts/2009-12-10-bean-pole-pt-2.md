Beans and poles were both invented roughly at the same time. <!--more--> There on one hand the bean, standing resplendent in the green or pod like formation it held from its youth, offset by the pole, staring blankly atÂ  future of mop-dom in suburbia. The two met eyes and instantly fell in love. Over time they grew bitter, tired of not having the time for each other or the ability to even sit in the same room as each other. Eventually beans and poles never saw another again. A bean would pass a pole and say &#8220;this is why the kids at school call the douches &#8220;bean-pole&#8221;&#8221;. Bean is before pole. Bean beats pole, the bean will always have the upper hand.

Here are some more examples of two words, one preceding the other with the former owning the latter:

### + Short- tall person (if you ever call a tall person this they will instantly SHRINK)

### + Future-past (this one is a time machine, with the future modified, the past is all like &#8220;woah no not me! please!&#8221;)
