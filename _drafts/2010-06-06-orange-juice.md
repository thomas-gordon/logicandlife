Inversion of the animal kingdom through rigorous testing and business implementation. <!--more-->That&#8217;s what yesterday&#8217;s paper had to say about the state of milk. We use milk as I&#8217;ve previously described for making our skin whiter. The problem now it seems is that life has taken a squeeze for the juice. What is the difference between juice and milk the critics ask. Well it isn&#8217;t the job of a critic to ask, but to rate. I rate it 4. Out of what? Cows have large pink udders. Bleeding into the udders is milk. So logically strawberry milk would come out of udders. But it&#8217;s white.

So cows got angry at this inversion of logic and stuffed oranges into their udders. By having oranges plague them the abominable logic of absence sang a prelude of liquid and the udders allowed the juice to pass on through unperturbed by the hoard of milk, which was redirected to the cows mouth so it could eat it&#8217;s own juices, giving humans oranges that are meaty, orangey and full of cow protein.

So what of milk. Do humans get milk as much as orange juice? Yes, yes they do. Despite this, milk must come from somewhere else. In all likelihood milk comes from distilled moon. Moon that has been discarded, mixed with sugar and yeast and blended into a paste and then combined with orange juice from cows so that milk could be said to come from cows. If none of this makes any sense consider this: There are way more people than oranges. How is it that I can purchase juice for less money than milk? Ridiculous.
