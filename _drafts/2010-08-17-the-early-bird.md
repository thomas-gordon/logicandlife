We&#8217;ve all heard that blasted saying that must have been invented by some genius capitalist. <!--more-->The early bird gets up and gets more done. What about all the shit that is easier at night? Aren&#8217;t there criminal birds? Surely they would prefer to conduct their business late at night as opposed to the bleary eyed morning. Are we to assume that there are no productive birds that get up late? What about the penguin? In Antarctica the penguin couldn&#8217;t even BE an early bird because the sun is all over the place there. Here&#8217;s another thing to consider: When you&#8217;re lying in bed in the morning and you hear the early bird going about its business is it ever the case that you get up and go and look at it? Further more why is it that birds even are more annoying in the morning? They shut up about midday. This kind of tells me that in fact early birds are woken up only because of the sun. These birds haven&#8217;t been able to find any shelter from those early morning rays so are burning. Burning up slowly and painfully. It takes a few hours and then they&#8217;re nothing but cinder. This kind of means that the metaphor for productivity is irrelevant because in summation:

  * Early Birds are homeless
  * Early birds can&#8217;t even be eaten because they&#8217;re burnt to charcoal
  * The screeching you hear in the morning is them in pain, not joy

Then there&#8217;s the painfully obvious point of worms being nocturnal. How can birds eat MORE worms in the morning than the evening. Even if they had the chance of escaping complete destruction by the sun there would be a very low chance of any worms crawling about on the surface. Worms dry up in sunlight because they&#8217;re mostly goo. So the early bird has: no food supply and very little chance of survival. If we are to follow the logic of this classic saying, &#8220;early&#8221; would be around 6pm. I work better around that time anyway.
