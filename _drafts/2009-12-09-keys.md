Keys are used all the time. <!--more-->You have a key to your house, to your letterbox, to your bedroom door, to your oven, to your chastity belt, to your fridge, to your money room (where you keep all your bills), to your dog, to your wife, to your husband and to your key chain. Ever thought that maybe it would be easier if we used mops instead of keys? You’d never lose a mop, they’re too big! Each one is unique and convenient for entering the mop locks and it ensures that everything is clean. For example with your dog, just cram the mop head into its mouth to unlock it.
