Cameras record things. <!--more-->Whether it be a camera for recording a moving stick (stickera) or a camera to simply take pictures (a picturepixelmaker). We love spending money on this crap but we don&#8217;t really know what happens to the money after we&#8217;ve spent it. Surely those drawers at JB hifi can only hold so much money before they explode? So what&#8217;s cheaper and takes up more space and time? Tape. Sticky Tape.

Tape was made to record life and everything that abounds inside it. It is clear, waiting to be ridden with the dirt of space time. Covering a room in tape will record anything that happens in there, it literally gets time to &#8220;stick&#8221; to it. No one has time to watch it all back so conveniently all you have to do is lick the tape, coating your mouth with the glue and giving you images as though you were looking through your mouth. Lick too much though and you may gluedose, absorbing an overwhelming amount of existence, resulting in death. So watch out for that!

Another advantage of sticky tape is that you can wrap it around your mouth, shutting you up. Finally you&#8217;ve stopped talking. Jesus. Ever tried not speaking for a long time? If you can&#8217;t do it then try this tape. You can just be sitting there and suddenly your mouth is filled with sticks. Wood. Painful? THEN SHUT UP and the stream of sticks, scraping and torturing your mouth will disappear. Try it on your cat. <img src="http://www.logicandlife.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
