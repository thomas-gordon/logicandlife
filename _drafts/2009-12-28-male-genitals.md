What is wrong with the penis. Seriously. <!--more-->I want to know what dickhead came up with that shape. There&#8217;s so much external that could be avoided. They completely cocked it up. Anyway I chopped mine off to have a better look. Underneath the microscope the penis appears flaccid at best. So what&#8217;s going on here. Shape?

People say having sex is like popping bubble wrap for a reason. The penis used to be a roll of bubble wrap. Fornication took place by the women popping as many bubbles as possible until a &#8220;ding&#8221; noise sounded and the pregnancy began. Seems like fun right? Until it went all so horribly wrong. A dude was popping himself in the shower and suddenly the gas heater in the next room exploded. The even completely fucked him up.

The surgeons tried to fix it but the plastic was all melted, the bubbles irrevocably damaged. So they had some fun and put some marbles in a sack and nailed it to the bottom of the twisted carnage. It&#8217;s a doctor&#8217;s in joke, when they help a boy get born as soon as the umbilical cord is cut they get a hair straightener, some marbles and a sack and some nails and get to work.
