    One of the many things that only humans do is &#8220;prepare&#8221; food.<img title="More..." src="http://www.logicandlife.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /> <!--more-->By this I mean we take bits of one thing, put it with another thing and then make it hot or make it cold. This is a point I would like to touch on. I would like to feel you and what I&#8217;m on about. I put cooking down to a few simple rules. First of all we never, ever eat food at the temperature it first existed at. So if you consider something like beef&#8230; we always cook it. There are no cows walking around with well-done legs (except if they&#8217;ve won a race and someone congratulates them) Our kitchens are built about the principal that something either has to be really cold (like a carrot or semi-yoghurt) or extremely hot, in fact far exceeding what we can put in our mouth for some time until it has cooled down.

    So why do we deal in such extremes? The answer I believe is in taste. Inside each food is a thing that coats your mouth in senseytinglestamps. These are tiny imprints that inform your mouth-reception that they are there for a meeting with the pleasure centre. Of course if you&#8217;re eating something disgusting like a Boab tree or shit then these senseytinglestamps get mad for waiting so long in line and shoot the receptionist, causing your tonsils to send anti-pleasure signals to the rest of your body and literally throwing the food out onto the street via the vomiting reflex.

    The thing is that in order for food to have this power it needs to be excited. Extreme heat and extreme cold is exciting for humans as much as it is for every other thing on this planet. The reason we love climbing stupid chunks of ice or getting down into plausibly erupting volcanos is that we are after the excitement of food. Because of that we eat food, not things like lava or glaciers.
