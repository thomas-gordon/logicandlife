Writing yourself into the pages of an already bursting cultural landscape is getting harder and harder. <!--more-->How does one make themselves feel like they are important or stand out from the rest of the crowd? Genetically it makes sense that this sense of immature self-esteem personality domination is irrevocable. Between the ages of 14 and about 30 the human is geared towards attracting the best mate. This means that they need to appear the most attractive, and the person with the most attention will have the greatest selection of people no matter what they look like. When you consider that due to our massively over-blown concept of what being &#8220;beautiful&#8221; is most people have low self-esteem about the way they look it&#8217;s no surprise that the way you are projected is paramount (this is of course markedly different from the true personality).

So this leads to a serious problem with the way we interact with each other. Let&#8217;s think about it from this perspective: There are two people. They are both loud, over dressed and way, way over made up.  They both like the way the other looks. When they talk they are awkward because they think the other person is attractive but most certainly not themselves. By complimenting each other they begin to feel more comfortable. Great! It&#8217;s all happy and positive because it has to be in order for them to feel good about themselves when they walk past the local Dolce and Gabbana ad. They&#8217;re both scared of each other so they project perfection. If it were possible to continue any relationship in this fashion it would be just fine buuuuuut the disgusting irony of the situation is that often the person who reveals the least amount of flaws, idiosyncrasies or truths is the person who has the most of these things. Eventually they come out and it&#8217;s often worse because the initial self-projection was such an outright fabrication.

We start to wonder why people go single and die. My advice to you is this: if you&#8217;re lonely and alone, considering fleeing to Germany or just drinking yourself into a stupor just look at some pigeons for a while. They&#8217;re quite happy both eating and being shit. The best people in the world can accept anyone looking at them in their most vulnerable state. I&#8217;m sick of all this &#8220;beauty&#8221;.
