In Australia on average <!--more-->we have less water than can come out of your tap. Most of the time when you have a shower it actually sucks any moisture OFF your skin in order to refill the catchments. Despite these annoying facts that interrupt daily life, people don&#8217;t seem to realise that if we take proper action we can refill the catchments, allowing the constant barrage of advertising us telling us to &#8220;drink less water&#8221; to end. Take out your paper and have a good long look at the current state of our water. Apparently it is 37% there. So 37% of all the catchments are full.

Now get a thermometer and shove it up your ass. I don&#8217;t mean lightly, really force it up there. Even if you&#8217;re not ready for it I want you to run as fast as you can to the bathroom and blindly throng it up. You&#8217;re sweating aren&#8217;t you! So you should be you dirty, dirty thing. Now take it out. What&#8217;s the temperature? 37. Degrees. Scientifically, body temperature is controlled by the amount of water in your system. If there&#8217;s not much water in that system then you&#8217;ll be hotter, requiring more to cool down. This relationship is directly transferred to the catchments.

If you had a fever of let&#8217;s say.. 60 degrees we might be able to remove those water restrictions once and for all. Farmers wouldn&#8217;t struggle with ongoing sandstorms and Darude wouldn&#8217;t step in and make bad puns. So either drink less water so we can all benefit or get a thermometer that you can bribe to show a hotter temperature than the one currently up your ass. Prick.
