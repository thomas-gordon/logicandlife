An elephant has a trunk that&#8217;s long<!--more-->, a car has a trunk that is inside of itself and sometimes you find trunks that are both filled with gold and a mix of the two formerly introduced in the beginning of this sentence fragment ruined by my verbose articulation. Yep, the trunk or &#8220;boot&#8221; is one of the most confusing things to learn about in the English dictionary. You can wear it, get molested by a beast with one, put valuables in it and then finally you can collect phones with it. Let&#8217;s assume that you&#8217;re in a sexual relationship with a brand new person. This person has ENORMOUS feet. Just too big for clown shoes. Aside from this they&#8217;re sincere, confident and just good at everything. You&#8217;re in love with them and you know you&#8217;ll always be faithful blabla bold and the beautiful.

Then one day you get a call in the middle of the night. It sounds a lot like the person you know you&#8217;re going to marry. You&#8217;re groggy because you&#8217;ve been asleep. They want to come over and have sexual intercourse. Your ears perk up and you are aroused. Off to the bathroom to clean your genitalia! After about half an hour you hear a car pull up into the driveway. You&#8217;re sweating with excitement about this sleep cycle interrupting hormonal rush. Then you hear kicks on the door and it&#8217;s your love&#8217;s feet. Just the feet, licking their lips and showing off their cracks in the most sleazy way. Then they jump into your Doc Martens and you hear the nasty. Your beloved&#8217;s feet are in there, sweating up an athlete&#8217;s foot storm of bacteria. So let this be a lesson to you all. Should you choose to accept a booty call from your clown of a partner, at least look through the door&#8217;s peep/gloryhole to ensure that all of your partner is on the other side. You never know what disease you&#8217;ll end up with.
