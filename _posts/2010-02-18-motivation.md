As far as people go, you&#8217;re ok. <!--more-->Everyday you get up, do your job and then you go to sleep without thinking. To most other people the mundane profanity of life doesn&#8217;t seem to matter. But then you consider your motivation. What does it mean to greater society to be motivated?Â The original word &#8220;motive&#8221; comes from the latin meaning &#8220;

*only used in the context of murder*&#8220;. When you&#8217;re watching a documentary on the murder of someone they always ask &#8220;what was the motive&#8221;? A useless question, the answer is always the same. The motivation was murder! Confusingly this is never uttered and all of you dolts probably go on just watching that shit.

Maybe it&#8217;s just that there is no meaning to life beyond the eradication of others. Millions of people try to convince themselves what&#8217;s going on is the meaning of life because we shape our daily path on the pure motivation to do SOMETHING. None of it is satisfying. Why? Because the only true motivation is murder. Believe the definition as you read it here.

Yet we&#8217;re told by all of our life lessons that without motivation we can&#8217;t get anything done. Through these lessons we&#8217;re being teased. Ohhhh no you can&#8217;t kill anyone but you have to be pro active and get shit done. Death-tease. You would think that at least they wouldn&#8217;t make murder illegal. I guess even if we did get to do it scott-free it would still feel wrong. Here lies the true mistake in our creation. Morals! We&#8217;ll happily do most of the other sins, apparently only this one is taboo! Get over yourself humanity. I&#8217;ve tried to reason with this language of hypocrisy but you know what? I don&#8217;t have the motivation. Trust me, that&#8217;s a good thing for the next person that pisses me off.
