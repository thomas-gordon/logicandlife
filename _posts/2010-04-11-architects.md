As much as the universities would hate to admit it, it&#8217;s plain to see that architecture is dead. <!--more-->It died somewhere in the 1950&#8217;s when the common nuclear house was invented. Perfect for about 3 or four people with room for extensions in case the missus accidentally got cum in. Air conditioning so the family could live in comfort. Gas, electricity and other commodities were turned on and have stayed on since.Â It just seems to me that teaching a whole lot of NEW people how to draw houses doesn&#8217;t make sense. When I was a child I drew houses and most of the time they were a lot more readable that the horseshit that the design institutions around the world are churning out every day. Talking to the architects of today is like talking to a child.

&#8220;I&#8217;d like a room that has a lot of light, can you just draw it so it faces the sun?&#8221;

&#8220;Sure! Just remember that my designs cost a lot of money because I sign the kitchen lightbulb when I&#8217;m done. Also I put all of the locks on the OUTside of the doors. OPEN PLANNING!&#8221;

There&#8217;s just one of the needless terms that I hear these rimmed glasses throwing around. &#8220;Open planning&#8221;, &#8220;Cubism&#8221; and &#8220;Post-Modernism&#8221;. Let&#8217;s simplify and toss out the wank.

  1. Open planning = no doors. people like doors so they can bone people while others are in the house so&#8230; fuck off.
  2. Cubism = Pointy everything. Pointy chairs, pointy tables, pointy carpet point pointy pointy. Guess what? Children are susceptible to pointyness. Soooo screw cubism.
  3. Post-modernism = Combining space, time and culture into one big mess means that a supposed real house is one room with no walls and no anything. So if that&#8217;s the future of architecture I&#8217;d much prefer to go back to the days of the caves and hire an ORIGINAL architect.
