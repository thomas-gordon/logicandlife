The Bendigo community bank is located in more than one community. The actual singular town called Bendigo is a gaping hole. A big, empty useless shit of a gaping hole in the countryside. It&#8217;s probably in a valley as well which would strengthen my argument but I hate the place so much that I can&#8217;t even be bothered getting out the satellite map and looking at the dirt bowl of nothingness to prove it. So why is it that when I walk up the hill every day to work there is one of its namesakes staring me in the face?

The explanation for the proliferation of community banks is weighty but needs attention. The banks need a few things to be established. First they pitch some horseshit speech about community and family values and giving them a pledge in order to &#8220;start a better community&#8221;. *Banks aren&#8217;t a place for drinking, fucking and fighting and that&#8217;s what all people see a realistic community to be. *Then after they have some arbitrary amount of money they start up and apparently they have great rates and no ATM fees. The problem in the case of something like the Bendigo banks is that the only ATM is *in Bendigo*. So you trek out on the rural trains just to go out and get slain in the heart of the Melbourne CBD? Ridiculous.<!--more-->

Then there&#8217;s the well known fact that the money that you put in these bank you never actually get back. With most banks if you give them a $20 note they&#8217;ll give you the exact same $20 note back after requesting it from an underground vault. A carrier pigeon gets it for you and you feel secure knowing that what you earnt is what is stored even down to the physical detail.

With community banks the notes are melted down into gold. This archaic stone age practice means that you never actually know how much money you&#8217;re going to get even if you&#8217;ve given $200 to the only teller that can speak Melbournese (the rest are all vomiting bendigo-eean). So why do they melt it down and why don&#8217;t you get what you gave back?

Bendigo and its surrounds used to be a tourist haven because there was so much gold to be mined. Now all the gold is gone, dug up by the commonwealth (bank). The only way to save this rural dumps is to pump new gold into the earth, generating a stream of revenue via tourism and hopefully filling the gaps in its literal existence as a hole.
