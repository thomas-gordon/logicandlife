Underneath everyone&#8217;s garments lie wear that we would commonly consider sexier than nowhere. <!--more-->Where on the body is the wear? Weeeeaarlll it&#8217;s underneath. Let me ask you a question. Penis or underwear that shows off penis? Bra or breasts hanging limply? All of these questions are ones no one wants to answer. Because of this we cover up underwear with over-wear. The problem for me as a philosopher with a Ph.D in pure hard dance is that it is not referred to as over-wear. Instead it is &#8220;clothing&#8221;. If you take off underwear it suddenly gets recategorised as &#8220;clothing&#8221; as well.

You put this &#8220;clothing&#8221; in a draw along with the other clothing that you own. Most certainly don&#8217;t see me wearing my chest of drawers so how is it that in a cupboard underwear is at the same level as over wear but wearever you wear it you can&#8217;t presuppose people will avoid looking at you. Odds are someone in underwear will look quite odd out in the cold of Winter as it is currently.

The solution to this problem is quite obvious. Stitch bras and jocks to your skin. Then wear ANOTHER set of &#8220;underwear&#8221; over the top of that. This will mean that when you get stripped down Â you still look attractive and alluring. Even better you can&#8217;t have sex so the tension in society will make everything interesting. The only way to see a breast would be to chase the local farmer down for the key to the chicken pens. Another thing, if chicken have feathers as clothing and no underwear, is roasting them considered the self-actualization of the beast? Maybe the intended state of a chicken is cooked to perfection in a bed of roast vegetables, lying next to a woman who is naked but for the clothing stitched into her skin, with a man lying sad next to her, castrated by the bird&#8217;s beak. Interesting.
