In the case of most words there are clear connections established. On the one hand you can have a word like &#8220;boat&#8221; and odds are you&#8217;re either staring at a sea vessel or listening to the tail end of a Canadian describing the best thing *aboat* their slightly miskempt hair.<!--more-->

With selling there is a big, massive confusion that goes on. Let&#8217;s say Dave Grindle comes up to you with some wares to sell. He&#8217;s got a small toupee, a medium sized aged cat and an ill-informed racist bigot up for grabs.

&#8220;Can I sell you this cat?&#8221;

&#8220;So you want me to have the cat in exchange for some money?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes. You&#8217;ll take the cat and you&#8217;ll have it until it dies unless you give it to something else for more money.&#8221;

&#8220;No.&#8221;

Why would I refuse such a generous offer? The salesman is clearly quirky and has a good knowledge of valuable artefacts. The issue is that the whole situation is a swindle in more than one way. If I want to be sold something I would like to be sold via the method of selling. By this I mean I need to exchange selling for money before any actual activity beyond this can occur. Life has to have logic to it. This kind of double standard is everywhere. Go to a clothing store and there will be no indication that anything is for sale. Maybe that there is A SALE going on. But nothing to indicate that the word doesn&#8217;t represent what it externally deemed to be.

Maybe you think this is anarchy. Why do things need to be explained to people? It&#8217;s simple. If it were explained that selling things is merely a link as opposed to a definition people would very quickly learn that stealing is bad. I understand this may be confuddling. So. A diagram!

To the person who walks off the street after being raised in a barn the selling and stealing is too much. To steal a thing is to be sold it without money. Stop trying to sell when what you&#8217;re doing just isn&#8217;t plain. While you&#8217;re there get some better pants, it looks to me that you have some issues with your zip trying to talk to your extraneous hair.
