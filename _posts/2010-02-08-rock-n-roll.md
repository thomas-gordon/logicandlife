Most music you listen to is rooted in rock and roll.<!--more--> It&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s boppy, catchy and horribly addictive. The derivitaves of rock n roll are many and lots of different people define it differently. Naturally there is a cause for this division of opinion and it all begins with the beat. The beat behind the music is crucial to its delivery. Of course you may not agree with this, I am a drummer myself and frankly a lot of a wanker because of it. Now onto population density. Look around you if you&#8217;re in the city and you&#8217;ll see most people with headphones on. Odds are they&#8217;re playing some kind of music, odds are again that this music has some kind of influence from rock and roll. This has got to mean something.

It seems like the more people appear, the less people are dead, and therefore less people are dying. There is less anger. Back in the day man used to beat up other man for the sake of it. There was nothing else to do really! No distractions as distracting as music obliterating your ear drums, causing you to tune out of average existence and forget who you are. Fights happened and people died. Good. The weak were ridden. Especially children, most of them didn&#8217;t survive because their school teachers used to get bored over lunch and beat the crap out of them.

Yes you got it right, BEAT. Death was down to the beat. The problem is nowadays we internalise the beat. It all started with those utter pricks &#8220;*The Beatles*&#8220;. If humanity is a virus, then this band was **patient zero**. Instead of killing each other we allow music to expunge this urge on our psyche. Therefore it&#8217;s also the reason there&#8217;s so much emotion floating around. We beat our selves up. Stress, relationship trouble, it&#8217;s all down to music. Now we&#8217;re all doomed.
