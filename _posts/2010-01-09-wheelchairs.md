I know what you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to take a cheap shot at the disabled.&#8221; <!--more-->Well I&#8217;m not. In fact I&#8217;m going to argue that they have it a lot tougher than you think. I recently went to see &#8220;Avatar&#8221;. Now while I enjoyed the movie immensely, there was one character that really got my jeffrey-augustine. That chair. Jake&#8217;s Chair.

Sitting in the background or next to the machine that Jake uses, it was a constant and mean reminder that every day not only do the disabled need to get their asses into a chair, they have to remove the plausibly 20 metre high pile of wheels that have come out of the Chair&#8217;s birthing hole. It&#8217;s a huge inconvenience when your chair gets pregnant, and most chairs are female. The male ones are nigh on useless (not unlike measles) and hard to sit on because there&#8217;s a penis right in the middle of the seat. 

So Jake&#8217;s chair sits there virtually the enTYRE time spitting out wheels. Why do you think that the movie is called &#8220;Avatar&#8221;? It&#8217;s because he needs to get high and go into another body to forget that he&#8217;s disabled and has to deal with an unfortunately clucky and pregnant chair. Wheel-protection services will be onto his ass in the sequel I reckon. He euthanised a bunch of them chairs.
