Now and again it all gets too much.<!--more--> Too much emotion, too many unfortunate cases of misdirection, too many things to deal with. Because this is such a universal problem it&#8217;s easy to think that everything is too much. If this is you then maybe it&#8217;s quicker if you 

*do *off yourself. If you have any self respect maybe you could consider my approach. It all revolves around the notion of shrinking everything to a few short bursts of knowledge. This way you can manage your life more successfully and succeed. Let&#8217;s say Jane has decided to build a car but she doesn&#8217;t know what fuel is. Instead of researching how to learn what fuel is and then having to follow that up with the *actual* learning, Jane could shrink everything about fuel down to &#8220;fire&#8221;.

Since making a fire is common knowledge she simply builds a bonfire in her car, lights it and away she goes, pistons made of forks firing as her exhaust splutters woodchips and coal. It&#8217;s not about thinking more basically. What I&#8217;m saying is that if everything was smaller we could excel at everything instead of endlessly strive for something which we consider must be part of a potential everything. Let&#8217;s take another example. Timmy can&#8217;t see. He&#8217;s been blind since he tried to wash his eyes with a hammer.

His version of everything now revolves around imagining he has eyes so hard that sometimes he&#8217;s sure he has them. Timmy is happy. He barely needs any stimulus to cum. Â Look at Michael. Michael can see just fine and he&#8217;s unhappy because he is constantly forced to do surgery and be in court in the same time. He gets a lot of money but because he worries about that his bank forgets it exists and then he has to work even harder.

A tunnel vision of everything makes sense broadly as well. We&#8217;d have far less kids around pissing everyone off if both men and women thought everything about sex was related to carrots. The women would insert them into themselves and the men would craft some kind of boiled warm hut to ejaculate into.
