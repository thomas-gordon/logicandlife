I stare at numbers at least 20min a day. I cut them out of the newspaper, lay them all out on the floor and wonder if any of them are irrelevant. No number is. All numbers matter to someone. Think about all those times you counted to 9 only to realise that the next step being 10 involved two numbers, both of which when added together equate to significantly less than 9. Positivity is a lot like numbers. If you have a number that isn&#8217;t negative, you have a positive number. Specifically note that:

&#8211; 1 = -1  
+1 = 1  
1 = 1

See how for some reason the + sign isn&#8217;t necessary to prove a number is greater than zero? Why is that? I won&#8217;t answer that. I just won&#8217;t. It is relevant to a Proof Of Positivity or for all you mothers out there &#8220;P.O.P.&#8221;. Â Now if you pop over to this other part of the post that you&#8217;re currently reading let me re-introduce you to a symbol that is the laziest, most asleep one of them all!

&#8211;

The negative sign is just the number one asleep. It&#8217;s lying down. It&#8217;s having a kip. It&#8217;s fast a-nap. It&#8217;s equal to half of its former standing up glory. Look at the sun. When it is lying down on the horizon approximately half of the light is sprayed all over your face. The same goes for the number one. Standing up its bright and painful to look at. Lying down it&#8217;s a shadow of its former splendiferousness. It&#8217;s equal to 0.5. A number one that is leaning at a 45 degree angle definitely represents 0.75. It&#8217;s almost awake but there&#8217;s a part locked in dream, like the silhouette of a support pole in an abandoned car park.

If we assume that a lying down number one is a negative sign then suddenly there is no option for numbers in the negative range. As everything is based on numbers we can&#8217;t say that anything is bad ever again. As you can see below through the use of pictures and things you can be 100% convinced that what I say is the truth.
