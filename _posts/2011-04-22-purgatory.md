There&#8217;s no specific reason why purgatory should be considered any one thing in particular. It&#8217;s just meant to be an in-between in space. In between all of the best and worst things; in terms of religious significance&#8230; hell and heaven. As a lot of people don&#8217;t succintly prescribe to the belief that there is any particular name for a god <!--more-->or whoseewhatsit there has to be a broader meaning to it. Perhaps you could trace it back to about 100 years ago when people first started to exist. (for the doubters with concern toÂ 

*that * truth, do you see any people older than that alive?) At this point there was a birth and an instantaneous attack and divide between good and bad, heaven and hell.

The drive to go from one place to another is powerful. The truth is that we&#8217;re relentlessly looking to go from one place to another. There is no time we can stop because to stop is to lose progression, age, breathing and life. If that&#8217;s the case then life is the start of the moving and death is the end. It seems here is the obvious parallel with the word &#8220;purgatory&#8221; and well uhh life? To be truthful most people are ok with living and would rather not die. For the ones who would rather die it may be truth that there is no purgatory to their existence. It&#8217;s more like hell. But I guess if you kill yourself while going through hell-on-earth wouldn&#8217;t that mean you go to hell(suicide is bible-bad) and combining these two mathmatical negatives end up at heaven? I guess that&#8217;s a nice thought.

So really for the instinctual in all of us earth is purgatory. This can be dumbed down quite simply to equating the will to live as purgatory. Before anyone was alive there was no divide between heaven and hell, indeed there wasn&#8217;t much going on. The world was apathetic and so were dinosaurs. S&#8217;probably why they became extinct.
