It&#8217;s getting to the silly season.<!--more--> That time of the year where humanity is largely overwhelmed by weather. In the US it&#8217;s all about keeping indoors and hot while outside reality is frostbite. Here it&#8217;s about &#8220;conditioned air&#8221;. It&#8217;s a control exercise. We feel that having pets and projecting our wishes, orders and abuse on animals isn&#8217;t enough. Having children isn&#8217;t enough. What little hold each one of us have over our lives is defined by the simple balance of being dominated at work dominating at home by&#8230; oh let&#8217;s say waiting just those few extra weeks before feeding your child or animal, just to hear them beg.

So yes, we control the air. It keeps us happy to put oxygen in its place. All high and mighty be the human that can pump the most temperate air through their house and cool it one minute faster than his or her neighbour. The thing about conditioning is that it always has a little box at the bottom of the page that ends up with you agreeing to give away all your rights to privacy on the internet. No one reads those things on sign up forms and most certainly no one takes into account the high probability that air will get back at them in the long run. That&#8217;s just the point isn&#8217;t it. You never need to run if you live in conditioned air. You hardly exert yourself because the machines pick up the fact you&#8217;re extremely hot or very cold and respond accordingly. If we are to believe ads, which I do, there are little men inside your Daikin inverter who watch you through a giant &#8220;eye&#8221; and work out when to give you more cool.

Given that this us the case, one could presume that everyone becomes cooler in the presence of an air conditioner. The issue with being cool is that eventually the fact is acknowledged and it becomes impossible to sustain the air of intrigue that you have established. When this happens you have to rely on your physical attractiveness. How hot you are can lift your cool status. The final solution to these devices is to never bother turning them on. This way the human genome will react and realise the only way we can get rid of sweat is to become more attractive.
