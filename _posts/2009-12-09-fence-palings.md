Invented roughly 1970 ago, <!--more-->these planks of wood collectively make up a fence. I’ve often wondered why not just use one big plank of wood but through my research I have learnt that they were superstitiously used to keep any race aside from whites out of a house. Hence the name “PALE” “ING”-doors. Only pale people were allowed inside the fence. The fact that the tradition remains is a testament to racism in western society.
