You know that parable that a spider is never more than a metre from you? <!--more-->A twisted, gnarled oak  is always less than four metres away from you. It may be tiny as a bonsai or just dormant in the ground but there is definitely the potential for practically any environment to be uprooted by the rooting of trees, weaving their militant path through the important parts of your life. Got a safe oven? Not if a branch finds its way up through the floor! Think that your escalators in the deepest part of the train network won&#8217;t have fruit bursting out of the walls, meaning you have to do a forced limbo as the machine propels you towards everyone&#8217;s job at the tax office? There is nothing safe from oak.

Now over to the plains of the gobi desert where trees are embraced. Such a separate, concrete free existence is lush with green sweeping statements of certainty all over the dirt and rubble. Right in the middle, at the north pole, there are four trees. Each of them carry about eight different much smaller trees with both the trees and their tree children have thirty types of fruit on each branch. You might argue that this volume of sugar and water would weigh down such a tempestuous situation but you&#8217;d be mistaken.

On the third tree there&#8217;s a branch that&#8217;s higher than any on all of the other trees put together. This branch has had offspring trees that live near you down the road. The ones that are plotting against the pavement. It&#8217;s a big deal. So this branch only produces apples. The deal is that for such a tree to be born there had to be. at the south pole, somewhere in mongolia, an utterly devastating frog&#8217;s mouth, one that could top any other frog. This frog with its obviously magnetised feet has to sit and breathe in so hard that through the core of the earth the pull keeps the biggest apple branch-treesholderman completely standing up straight. If it weren&#8217;t for the biggest mouths in the animal kingdom we wouldn&#8217;t have any fruit at all. Or any ice on the poles.
