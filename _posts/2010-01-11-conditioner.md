Sailors used to wash on boats. <!--more-->They had showers. They were clean. Hell the ocean is a dirty place. Sand, sea, Suns, Moonrays late in the morning and a giant posiedon cardboard cutout to worry about. Then one day they stopped doing it. Now they stink worse than everyone in the world. I guess it&#8217;s fair because it was at sea that hair conditioner was born. The good ship calstus stood against the gentle ocean waves. It had been docked in chalgroim for sometime. The boat was ready to leave but the sailors were too busy grooming, sitting around brushing each other&#8217;s hair or cleaning each other&#8217;s anuses with their mechanical knives. Calstus started to get bored. Bored like you&#8217;ve been doing nothing for three days and it&#8217;s not even procrastination. You have no money and no petrol and no car and hardly any toilet paper. That&#8217;s how bored you are. You can&#8217;t even wipe for very long on the toilet.

The ship was held together by some very tight knots. The knots started to get uncomfortable. There was no reason for them to be so tight when the boat wasn&#8217;t doing anything. Being a knot is like being constipated. You hold on because you can&#8217;t let go. Then one of the knots got a big splash from a particularly powerful wave. It started to gyrate against the other knots. Pretty soon the entire rope was having unspeakable sex in all the spots where knots existed. Then after about five minutes the knots came. And came HARD. These things had never even masturbated! The glue like semen was everywhere and the knots fell apart, they couldn&#8217;t hold on any longer, they were too lubed up. Like being on the phone to telstra.

The boat went out to sea and all the sailors except one died in a storm because none of the knots that held the boat secure were done up. This sailor went home and told this tale. First to a hair company because he realised that a lot of people would want the knot-semen tip, second to his sailors, who swore never to waste time on grooming, to get out to sea as quickly as possible so the knots wouldn&#8217;t get bored. Conditioner. Knots having sex in your hair.
