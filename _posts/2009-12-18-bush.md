What animal is the most powerful of all? The bush. <!--more-->There are trees that loom large in my rear view mirror as I drive down the road. There are tall buildings that open their mouths (which are made of windows). There are cars that pass by and fly off into the night. Mega birds walk the earth but the bush is the most amazing. Why? Because it&#8217;s covered in legs and arms which are called &#8220;branches&#8221; by most (or moist). The bush can walk or run or hold things anyway it likes. And each has a more amazing set of limbs. Ever seen those cartoons where the &#8220;person&#8221; runs around the bush before going and brutally murdering someone?

Well there is no person. Bushes are the perfect assassin. They could hold 40 guns, one in each branch. They could Roll, walk, run, throw, bounce, skip, dive and yell all at the same time. Why do you think it&#8217;s called &#8220;bush bashing&#8221;? That&#8217;s right, they&#8217;re out to get YOU.
