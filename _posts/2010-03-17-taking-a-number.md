Social ranking.<!--more-->We&#8217;re all after it. Facebook eloquently has told us that the best way to measure each other is through comparing one another. This makes sense on many levels. While the average joe who sits at home and has no friends will rank fairly low on the chart, the classy guy with grease running through his hair and a tight leather ensemble will rank much higher, obviously by definition exuding the cool factor.

There is a school in&#8230;&#8230;.. Darwin, South Australia that has a much better system for managing the popularity of its students. Every day at 6am the school buzzer rings out a high, shrill, piercing, dominating tone that comes out from a surgically implanted ringer in the cochlear region of each student. Then the trim taut crew of students begin to run as fast as they can in the direction of the school. What follows is a number of specifically designed tests, each one separating one student from the rest of the pack until the last is deemed the best and the least dead. This functions as a parallel to the societal nature of hyenas.

So the first to the school gets a number. She sits down at the reception waiting to get in to start the physically taxing tasks. Then suddenly a large hammer comes along from the sky. It could be god but it&#8217;s probably just the fact there&#8217;s no water in Darwin so it&#8217;s she&#8217;s dehydrated. Anyway so the hammer comes down and flattens the shit out of her body. So she gets crushed into something resembling a cherry flavoured roll-up.

The native flame-thrower aptly named &#8220;steve&#8221; gets out his thrower and torches some numbers into the flattened, drying-in-the-heat corpse. Then the corpse has the edges cut off and is put in the oven to shrink like those old &#8220;shrinkies&#8221; that you got in cereal packs. Finally the piece of human that remains is attached to a roll and then added to one of those machines in lobbies where you take a number. So next time consider that if you do decide to take one, you&#8217;re taking a life. You animal.
