The face of an object is always flat. The face of a person is not flat unless they really like pressing it against glass really hard because they&#8217;re inquisitive as to something behind the glass like a puppy. In fact the capacity for a person to flatten their face hasn&#8217;t been well enough documented. There is no rhyme or reason as to why we have facial features that stick out like craggly rocks from the lemming cliff.

When we look at the time on the wall it&#8217;s only with a partial curiosity. All the cogs and wheels in an analog clock are irrelevant. If you look carefully at the hands they&#8217;ll tell you what minute or hour it is. If you cross your eyes you can combine the minute and hour hand into one true time hand, telling you exactly what the time is at that precise moment.

Analog clock faces might seem flat but as spacetime is the fourth dimension one would have to deduce that they are neither flat nor protruding or I guess theoretically *both*. So why do we call them faces? It has been highlighted to me through the method of mouth talking that the reflective nature of most clock faces means you can see yourself in time. You can view yourself in direct relativity to the position in time that you are placed at. Through this we learn that the comparison of how old we are or our mood is sometimes directly related to time. You see yourself in 6pm on an analog clock and it&#8217;s like you know you need one more coffee to get through the main slog of the last four hours of awake time.

But do clocks have faces when we aren&#8217;t looking at them? What if we&#8217;re asleep! Maybe this is why sleep seems to go so quickly. Not restricted by our faces reflected in them, analog clocks go faster like an emu released from a canary cage after a long sea-faring voyage. Look at Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity;
