There is little doubt that all humans do is stare at gaps. We get worried when there are gaps in the ceiling. Gaps between doors. Gaps in our relationships. Spaces between drinks. Brief interludes between heroin trips. It&#8217;s all just worrying about gaps. Heterosexual men worry about vaginas because they are complex and not penises. Women worry about penises because if they&#8217;re revealed to be cut in half when the pants cut off the correct half is hard to choose.

Fundamentally the splitting of things is not about the moment it&#8217;s split; more the moment or potential for the object to be recombined into a shadow of its former self. Take for example a door being opened. The moment of the wall splitting open and something coming through is interesting, we all turn to look. But why do we look until *the door is closed*? Similar to men staring at cleavage of any woman. If enough of the cleavage is showing men are interested because their minds combine the two half breasts into ONE FULL BREAST. They stare at the middle of the bosoms in the vain hope that their vision will go cross eyed and they will be presented with at least one breast.

The plumbers crack is another example where we have to stare until the gap is filled. The plumber bends over, we stare at the asscrack. We keep staring until it becomes a full ass again, the crack hidden behind the trusty overalls/jeans. Same with the zoo animals.

The only exception is bananas. No one wants a banana whole. They want a banana split. The lumped issue then presents itself as the meaning of &#8220;whole&#8221;. This word translates from the greek for &#8220;What Hole?&#8221; As in.. Where is the hole? We&#8217;re always looking. We only find upon combination of a destroyed whale. Why whale? Because a destroyed whale has already answered this question;

&#8220;What Ale?&#8221;

The answer is of course as old as time&#8230; &#8220;All the ale that could fit in a wale&#8221;. This meaning that the original drunkard was a whale. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called &#8220;A whale of a time&#8221; when you get so smashed that you piss into the gutter grill. All the fish that get through the baleen by accepting the nature of the party life.
