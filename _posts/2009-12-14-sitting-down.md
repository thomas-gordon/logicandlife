Sitting. Sat. Sit. Now sit down AGAIN. Can you do it?  
<!--more-->

  
Back in the day philosophers and poets would muse about this paradox. If we are to stand and then to sit why does it behove us to stand again as opposed to sitting again! Why aren&#8217;t there multiple levels of sitting defined by the dictionary? It makes perfect sense that different cheeks, left and right have disparate and combined levels of power. If you only sit on one cheek, why isn&#8217;t that called &#8220;sinky&#8221;? Your ass is gradually &#8220;sinky-ing&#8221; into the chair. Perhaps you like to release gas from your anus. Hey who doesn&#8217;t like a good &#8220;release gas from your anus&#8221;. I do, you do, we call it the &#8220;sinky release&#8221;. Only when both cheeks are firmly in the chair should the word &#8220;sit&#8221; come into play. Then there is the circumstance where you sit so hard that the chair breaks. Have a break, have a Sit-Sat. One thing about that&#8230; if you are going to have a sit-sat, don&#8217;t eat the chocolate bars that come out of your ass.
