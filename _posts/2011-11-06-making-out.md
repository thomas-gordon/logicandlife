If you&#8217;re at a social gathering where saliva is encouraged it&#8217;s often the case that someone, somewhere inside the building&#8230; is making out. They aren&#8217;t making out like they aren&#8217;t kissing, they&#8217;re acting as though the kissing is of a higher public and symbolic value by referring to it as &#8220;making out&#8221;. If you&#8217;ve got your tongue in the vicinity of another person&#8217;s tongue your mind is constantly wondering if your attempt at mouthal coitus is going beyond the standard and commonly desexualised &#8220;kiss&#8221;. You are making out to the other person that you are better at sex than you probably aren&#8217;t.

We tend to move our bodies a lot more when you&#8217;re making out. You kinda gyrate like an idiot. Often one of the parties will kinda wiggle their legs a bit. What&#8217;s with that? Perhaps this is related again to the vision of an act more than the act itself. You aren&#8217;t actually fucking but your sexually inebriated crotch sure thinks it is! Except that it&#8217;s fully clothed and you haven&#8217;t the necessary power, will or appropriateness to actually have sex. If we weren&#8217;t making out as though we were almost fucking then what would be doing doing? Having sex. All the time.

Think about the other things that lead up to making out! You talk for ages using your mouth. If you talk for more than 20min you will find the average person starts showing off their tongue a lot more. They&#8217;ll run it around the edges of their mouth and then yawn obviously to show just WHAT a mouth they have! If the other party is interested in this display of mouthal prowess then often the reaction is to kinda just stare as though entranced.

Once the trancelike viewing of these oral gymnastics is complete the common path is to combine the two people&#8217;s saliva. It&#8217;s more than true that commercial lubricant is the combined saliva of several.. let&#8217;s say 6.. different people making out. I think the real trick to true making out is kind of dribbling as you do and angling it so that the saliva just kinda falls on your combined crotch. That way you reach the next stage. No fake bullshit, no try hard performances.. just &#8220;making it&#8221;.
