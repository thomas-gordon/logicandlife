Every summer dad and the kids and mother would take us to the seaside. <!--more--> We&#8217;d frollock in the sand and the sun, giving our souls to the ocean waves around. Then we would have to go back to the tents and sleep. Camping was an utter riot. Literally. Night times were spent plotting the next move of the fleet. Where will the family attack the enemy from. The front? Maybe we&#8217;ll get little Casey up the front. She/He is ready for action. 

*WHOOPS* He&#8217;s slipped on a tent peg. Those things are quite dangerous kids. Whoops Derrick is watching Justin vomit on the 4WD from all the pressure! Camping. Vomiting, Eating, Fighting. Camping.
