Gather around the fire children, for I have a tale for you.  The year was sixty-three or thereabouts.. I can&#8217;t recall if it was nineteen sixty-three or twenty one sixty-three. Not relevant, we weren&#8217;t born yesterday! So our protagonist is a child named Ellie. For years she had grown up in a house made of bricks. The kind that catches the eye on a bored sunday while walking the obligatory animal. The garden was wide. About forty five feet wide. It was easy to tell the width of the garden from watching Ellie&#8217;s face and counting her freckles. 1,2,3, four freckles. 1,2,3,4 feet of yard.

The specific timing of our tale is not known. All we know is that Ellie was young, and not young in the traditional sense. She was about four *or* n&#8217; twenty if you can&#8217;t make up your mind. The bad guy was young too, a pasty pastry eating porous fountain of infectious tripe. Gerald was his name. To Ellie he symbolised something far worse than just an opponent in gender and requisite stereotype. He brought about a deep sense of fear. Waves of nausea would wash over her when his pasty face appeared, even when his face had just crossed the dawn of her peripheral.

Gerald would walk casually around like nothing mattered. Ellie would walk the opposite direction in the vain hope of avoiding  another nausea drenched trip to the school nurse. Every time she went to the nurse she would be subjected to saying &#8220;Ahh&#8221; and showing the nurse her tonsils, which happened to have swapped with her tongue about three hours previously. Needless to say, it was not an embarrassment she had come to terms with yet.

Ellie was on pain meds that made her sick. Gerald had held her in a recent fit when she vomited near unconscious for four straight hours. Now the sight of him triggered her memory of that day.
