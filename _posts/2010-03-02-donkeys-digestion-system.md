Oh my stars!<!--more--> There it was, in the middle of a field&#8230; a giant rock. There hadn&#8217;t been rocks for at least the last 20 kilometres and no one was prepared. Tomas sat down very quickly as if he had no legs. &#8220;Why did you sit so fast Tomas?&#8221; cried Agenta. Agenta had a androgynous Â name but let&#8217;s assume it was a girl for the sake of the story. &#8220;I find that if you sit faster you feel more alive. I think I sat so hard that time I broke my ass.&#8221;

&#8220;Leave Elmine alone!&#8221; said Agenta, pointing to their ass; the donkey seeming dejected by Tomas&#8217; blind remarks.

Tomas ignored the bad joke and walked up to the rock, hitting his head very hard repeatedly against its solid foundations. Agenta approached Tomas&#8217; now limp and unconscious body, broken from hitting his head against the wall, and took his wallet. She got onto Elmine&#8217;s back and rode away towards the cliff. Suddenly Tomas appeared before them as a ghost, clearly having died from the rock that got in his way.

&#8220;Mouth fuck me moutherfucker!!!&#8221; cried Elmine before taking not only the ghosts ice cold member but his whole body into his large, dislocated jaw. From the ass of the ass the ghost soon emerged, solid and shit-covered. It seemed the digestive system of the donkey had resurrected the man. Tomas stood up, brushed himself down and then got a toothbrush and brushed his teeth. Fresh and clean as a daisy he stole back his wallet and bought the donkey some congratulatory cow lactate.
