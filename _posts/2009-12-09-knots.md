Knots are as confusing as they sound. <!--more-->They seem to contradict themselves, switching between actual troublesome things that stop what you are doing and things that can hold you by a limb from falling off the earth. Assuming that a knot is both inconvenient and life-saving, we could liken them to a very large chainsaw, which can be used for saving someones life if they&#8217;re stuck up a tree but are very heavy and difficult to carry around. On top of all this the knot itself is a denial of existence, deriving directly from the word &#8220;not&#8221;, which means (care of google)

&#8220;negation of a word or group of words;&#8221;

Now if this is **ACTUALLY **the case then we&#8217;re in for some serious trouble because it would undermine the meaning(s) of the word. &#8220;knot&#8221; can therefore be described as both a negation of existence, a life saving tool and quite plausibly a chainsaw. Watch out world!
