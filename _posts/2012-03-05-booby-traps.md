A dark wave was pushing one of the only unmanned vessels across the largest ocean in the world, the east pacific ocean. The captain; who was a satin bower bird of noble upbringing and almost negligible  post traumatic disorder, was standing at the stern of the boat passing down orders to the shipmates which were a rag tag crew of younger bower birds, all having eaten each others wings in a late night bush brawl.

It was the only way of travel for these birds. Straight across the sea in search of the crack-heroin of their world; blue objects. For some reason the irony of searching the vast blue ocean for blue things was completely lost. Convenient segue; they were completely lost.

Eventually the captain waved his stumpy arm at the coast of the galapagos island that they were almost passing by. One of the many problems with captaining a vessel designed by birds is that they haven&#8217;t invented anything beyond piles of faecal matter and leaves. These smart bowerbirds had invented a cavity made of these two substances and then jumped in it. Unable to get out the captain had birdnapped them and pushed the vessel into the ocean. Following this they had been accidentally propelled by the physical result of the in-fighting and sexual deviancy inherent in a bunch of trapped birds.

The beach they fought onto was a long stretch of white sand. The birds [tweet][1]ed at each other but the louder ones ran out of characters and died.

Sure there were blue things to be found. There were finches lurking in the upper tree trunks. Some of the larger turtles had blue tongues because the sky burnt them that way; it&#8217;s a common misconception that sunburn makes your skin red. The sky is blue and burns as such. Herpes is red. Get it checked.

All of a sodden it rained solidly for over 4 days. The birds were cold and shivering, the withdrawal from their last sight of an obtainable blue thing having been weeks ago when Mildred the whale ate half the boat. The moralbatross was at an all time low when around the corner of the galapacave came some blue feet. Shining bright in the overcast light the feet were mezmerising for the crew.

Then, the blue foot exploded and then all the birds were dead. A passing [blue footed booby][2] sighed deeply and exclaimed &#8220;I told him not to realise he had feet! We&#8217;re the only ones with feet that are so idiotic. If we realise we have feet then&#8230;&#8221;
