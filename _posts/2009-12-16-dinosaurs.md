Wow. Dinosaurs. <!--more-->Everyone I know is a dinosaur. And here we are presented with another paradox. Can Dinosaurs read? If not, what are we supposed to do with all the books our writers have translated to english? The advantages of having a dinosaur as a loved one, friend, close acquaintance are many. There are so many 

**advantages** I&#8217;ll have to list them:

  * Need something to do? Tap your friend&#8217;s other shoulder and watch as your friend (who would never suspect you) eats your other friend&#8217;s head as punishment.
  * Want to play basketball? Bad luck, most dinosaurs don&#8217;t even have arms.
  * Is your friend a raptor? He&#8217;s got a great flow doesn&#8217;t he, he could almost spit rhymes&#8230; RAP-TORiffically, better than Eminem!
  * Are you the only vegetarian on earth? You&#8217;ll have real friends now, a lot of dinosaurs were vegetarian!
  * Odds are if you&#8217;ve got enough friends at least one of them will have free tickets to get into jurassic park.
