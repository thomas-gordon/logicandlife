Yes we all do it. <!--more-->Walk up the thin stairs and are faced suddenly with someone going the wrong way. Well at the very least what you consider to be the wrong way. You don&#8217;t quite know why that person is walking in the same direction as you when there is blatantly space for them to move. So there&#8217;s a couple of seconds where you have to either make the submissive pass to the opposite side of your opponent or look straight ahead as if they weren&#8217;t there and dominate. The unique thing about this situation is that it happens all the time.

The human mind can only take so much of thisÂ pummelling. It&#8217;s why road laws were invented in the first place. It used to be a free for all on highways with cars allowed to travel on either side of the road but the mental toll was worse than seeing your family murdered. In big buildings there are lane marking as well, clearly designating where people can and cannot walk. If this is the case why is it that we aren&#8217;t allowed to put up lane dividing walls at sea? The whole reason that whaling has been going on for so long is that the boats RUN INTO oncoming whales.

There is no malice involved; in fact most of the boats that kill the poor creatures are out looking for pheasant as is the custom on the sea. So the next time you run into someone in the corridor by mistake if they&#8217;re dressed as a whale kill them, chop them up into sushi and feed them to the other people in your lane.
