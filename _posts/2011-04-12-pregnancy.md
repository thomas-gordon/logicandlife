There should be no ridicule of birth. It is in the act that many achieve their purpose and miraculously decide that their life is worth living. It is in birth we find babies and in babies people have solace that their lives haven&#8217;t been entirely wasted. It is more the physical nature of being pregnant that inevitably fascinates. I&#8217;ve covered getting pregnant. But why do certain things happen to a woman&#8217;s nature during the period of incubation?<!--more-->

Take for example the woman&#8217;s &#8216;period&#8217; or &#8216;blood time&#8217; that tends to occur. Why does this disappear when the child is inside? How about the question of the cravings that are ellicited, never mind the fact that women seem to become very fat extremely fast while they are getting pregnant and then lose it all faster than a George Foreman grill when the baby erupts from the lady&#8217;s nether.

Firstly the periods. They go and it would seem while the lady seems content there&#8217;s actually some seriously funky shit goin&#8217; awn down thar. The child which of course needs a mouth before any other vital organ scurries around feasting on the banquet of lining created monthly along the intestinal, urethral and uteral walls. This explains how humans have blood in the first place. Next the kid grows eyes so that it can see all the nooks and crannies where the spare blood has been stored. This is why the period never exists, it&#8217;s baby food!

The cravings are mind control devices for the baby to test out its power and to seek more food for itself. A lot of the fattier foods have a higher concentration of blood in them such as chips, yoghurt and gravy. The child just wants more to eat. Assuming your wife would like some crisps at 4 in the morning it&#8217;s because the blood has run dry. A side effect of all the food is the weight.

When the child is born it is pissed off. Of course it is! All covered in blood the baby is trying to get one more feast and you just pulled it outta there like a cockroach off a garbage heap.
