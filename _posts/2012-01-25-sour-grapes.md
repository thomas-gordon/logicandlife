Your average $10 bottle of wine is distilled from alcohol and tanning residue. It&#8217;s bottled cheaply, coloured and then labelled as something it&#8217;s not. The whole practice takes place in silence because for some reason it&#8217;s a social faux pas to disturb it. The more expensive wine is mixed with some kind of **secret dirt** so when it&#8217;s &#8216;decunted&#8217; everyone is impressed at just  how clean it comes out of the bottle despite the layer of crud seemingly mixed in with it all.

The sourest, most unripe grapes at a vineyard are always devoured by the local birds. Birds always eat them far before humans can stomach them. The grapes that are left are used unceremoniously to construct ye olde cask wine. The cask  is inhaled ceremoniously at the passing of the day and is often following by the passing of the out.

Grapes left over from making the prestigious cask wine are given to supermarkets. These are the useless green seedless variety common in supermarkets. This ill, impotent grape is what you feed your children. So the hole in this scenario is a singularity. Normal wine, as I previously mentioned, is created without grapes. So how is the premium wine made? It&#8217;s fairly simple. Expensive wine farmers often wear suits when they exist. They&#8217;ve got a lot of money so you&#8217;d think it makes sense. In actual fact it comes down to the suits being used as a critical bait. They farm in suits too! Did the Overnment ever tell you *that*?

The birds that eat the sour grapes still piss and shit just as much as the next man. It&#8217;s just that a sour bird is one who is looking to score. They&#8217;ve ingested the disgusting fruit and need the financial support to live with their digestive issues. So they fly about looking for a **suit**or. It is in this scenario that our rich farmers succeed. They get the birds with their well groomed appearance and then keep them locked in a &#8220;Wine extraction cage&#8221; where gradually the fluids and shit are leaked out into fake-dusted bottles.  The sediment which you love and cherish is the bird&#8217;s sour grape shit. The rest is just piss.
