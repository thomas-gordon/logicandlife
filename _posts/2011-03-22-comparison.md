Fuck. Stuck down the well again. <!--more-->If only I had considered that looking inside the well for snails wasn&#8217;t the wisest of choices. There are surely ample snails on the surface. Guess I figured that the snails were more likely to be down in the water. Saw that movie about snails who swim. That wasn&#8217;t in this country though. It was&#8230; If I remember&#8230; Snails!!! No. Wales. Oh yeah that&#8217;s right. Whales only live on the land in Wales.

Ok need a climbing implement. Maybe if I use a similar word and said it enough the comparison would cause some thesauruses to appear out of the air. Ok. &#8220;RAPE. ROPE. RAPE. ROPE. RAPE. ROPE!!!!&#8221;. Nope. This story reminds me of a collection of poems I was read as a child. The pages were in constant conflict with one another. A poem on one page would argue that the other page was better and I shouldn&#8217;t be reading it in order to learn about the other. Despite this irrefutable paradox I continued to get lost until *wait. * Ah! A person at the top of the well!

&#8220;Excuse me I&#8217;m stuck in this well!&#8221;

&#8220;No, you ain&#8217;t stuck yet!! Here&#8217;s some hot glue in a bucket ta git ya real stuck thar!&#8221;

Farmers are only nice to cows and I&#8217;m definitely the udder species. Now the issue is that even if I could move my limbs I&#8217;d have no one to explain my situation to except the sky and we all know how unreliable that Pubic Degenerate is. Not sure what I&#8217;m going to do with my erection as well; it&#8217;s glued to my stomach. Something about being in a moist dank hole in the earth. Ah! There&#8217;s a snail. Good. At least that&#8217;s why I was here in the first place.

\*zzzz\* Ah! My mobile phone. Excellent. One of my legs is free. Compared to before I can see a lot more down here. You never really stare at your legs. You do it in public and people think you are worried your feet smell or your toes are the wrong length. *Steer clear of that kind of judgement*.

Later I looked back into the well to see my skin which I had peeled out of lying sad in the steamy glue. I had loosened from the restraint and weight of the epidermis and now my skull reflected the sun onto the moon and the unfortunate truth burnt into my retina: &#8220;I&#8217;d have to sleep without eyelids like a snail&#8221;
