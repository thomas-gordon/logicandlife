Everyday when you bend down <!--more-->to do up your shoes do you ever wonder if your shoes could double as boats? As it turns out, all shoes that are made are made based on the principals of boats. The laces are the sailors, securing the deck and making sure the boat doesn’t sink. The sails are your socks and below deck are your toes. Now try walking on water. Suddenly works doesn’t it! This serves to explain how jesus walked on water. If you realize your shoes are boats, you can too.
