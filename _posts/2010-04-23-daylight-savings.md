Steve hurried to the main viewport of the ship. <!--more-->The deck was wet, not unlike the blow up doll he had spilled the barbeque sauce on earlier. Brown and plasticine. &#8220;haha!&#8221; laughing on boats is somehow different to laughing on land. Is it because the power of the boat is in its separation from other people? You can laugh, loud and booming, and the only dudes that&#8217;ll get pissed off are the krill because think you&#8217;re a whale coming to eat them. What you&#8217;re worried about some krill&#8217;s personal feelings? Go hug a diseased rat.

Steve wandered around the ship to his binoculars that can one of those massive zoom lenses on it. It was so powerful that the only way you could see anything was by being at sea. If you used it on land you&#8217;d only get ocean. Thus we come to the climax of this particular story. Inherent in the power of this lens is a power to do shit with time. And there&#8217;s one on every single yacht. Why is that? Because yachts are easy to make. Yacht makers need interest too so they learnt how to make really powerful precision lenses. 

So if you&#8217;re out at sea you can see a clock in someone&#8217;s house. All you have to do then is set the clock on your boat to one hour behind. You figure they&#8217;re about an hour away in terms of boat speed so it makes perfect sense. When you actually get to them your clock is still one hour behind the houses clock so you&#8217;ve already adjusted your body clock. So you change that clock. This ripple effect is what&#8217;s known as daylight savings. So why does it happened at the same time of year? Only twice a year?! Frankly it&#8217;s because people on boats are on boats for a reason. They don&#8217;t like land but the only way of getting food is to come home. And frankly most humans work better under regimented work schedules.
