The Cosmos is vast. Ever lasting. Recently reading through all of Hawking&#8217;s books in the last four hours I&#8217;ve come to realise that we are just small, cumbrousÂ pieces in the grand scheme of things. There is absolutely no relevance to anything we do. That said, what is relevant is timely and as the universe is old it&#8217;s old news. This means the knowledge of being irrelevant is completely useless to us practically. It&#8217;s like saying &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I got to work because if the dinosaurs were alive I might&#8217;ve been eaten&#8217;ve.

By the same token, space is relevant given its proximity to us. There are endless ways of describing things that are near you but all occupy the same space. It&#8217;s like that old parable about the tortoise and the worm. The Tortoise was walking to get some milk from his nearby cow. The worm was under his feet and eating some dirt. The tortoise also eats dirt. Just goes to show you, worms can have shells and nerves harder than steel.

Then there are the stars. Stars litter the sky more than my old cat could use in the laundry. Their light apparently takes over one earth year to travel, meaning they&#8217;re over one year&#8217;s hike away. If your eyes could leave your body at the speed of a star&#8217;s light you could see a lot more in a lifetime than the average body could put up with. It&#8217;s all just infinitely complex. It is possible to describe how much stuff there is but it&#8217;s impossible to speak enough to say it all. This might be the real reason we never shut the fuck up. It explains why a stranger will come over to you at the supermarket and ask you if you&#8217;ve seen his keys. You have seen his keys. You have seen his keys back near the bread. You know to explain to him that you don&#8217;t need to use a key to get through the crust in a loaf. The stars don&#8217;t speak at all. Maybe that&#8217;s the real lesson here.
