Um. How do markets get their goods so fresh?Â <!--more-->Every time I go to the local market there&#8217;s fresh fruit, fresh meat and fresh seafood. It&#8217;s great and all so cheap. It also carries an air of authenticity, of the food being &#8220;better&#8221; for you than the average supermarket fair. the only annoying thing about markets is the opening hours. They&#8217;re only ever open for about 6 hours on any given day and they close sometimes for days at a time for some secret reason. I was talking to a Salami the other day and I found out what the story is.

The market closes for the day and sealed up tight. Then the halls are flooded with salt water and fish eggs are thrown into the water. The reason markets are hardly ever open is because it takes time for the fish to grow and mature (roughly a day or two). When the market reopens the sea water is drained and there are fish left on the floor. This saves having to move them from the real ocean which costs money (hence the low prices of goods at markets) and allows the produce to be as fresh as possible. As it happens to save space the beef, poultry and chicken meat you buy are genetically modified to have gills, they grow and live in the market ocean as well. Floating trees support the fruit and veg.

So why are supermarkets named like that if markets are clearly superior? It&#8217;s because the effort required to get all the produce from all over the world (as opposed to on the doorstep) is large&#8230; super if you will. Markets have it freaking easy.
