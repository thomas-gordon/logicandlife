Every day when you wake up, there are bottles in the kitchen. <!--more--> There are probably bottles underneath your mattress when you sleep. People use bottles for holding things but mostly for smashing them on stuff. You have a bottle for smashing your friends in the face when they&#8217;re telling you you&#8217;re a violent person. You have a bottle for dropping off the roof in case you get in one of THOSE moods and you have a bottle for the bottle battle of 2010. Whether you choose to join the enemy is up to you but if you choose the dark side I want you to leave, take all those bottles off the freaking wall and never come back. Seriously I guess it&#8217;s a good thing, all they do is take up space. Ridiculous.
