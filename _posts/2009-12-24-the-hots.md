About oh&#8230; let&#8217;s say 40 years ago God made the earth, sun, sea and people. <!--more--> For all you knew your grandfather probably watched it all from the war! He&#8217;d be sitting there in his bunker and God&#8217;d all be like

*&#8220;sea is pretty hard to invent, there is all this shit under there that no one can see! I don&#8217;t get the credit I deserve <img src="http://www.logicandlife.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> <img src="http://www.logicandlife.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> &#8220;*

Hell, your grandad probably helped him out with this problem, explaining that water is made from the sky and if you invert the sky with the sea suddenly there&#8217;s all this water that wasn&#8217;t there originally. Of course this means that the sea is at least as old as your grandad. Go on, ask him! *** **After all of that making stuff happened, God invented the hots. We&#8217;ve all been through it. You come across a large womenÂ  or man, roughly 7 feet tall and weighing oh.. 250kg. You realise that you&#8217;re hungry but preceding this urge is the hots. You try and run. Run away as fast as you can. Nevertheless you can&#8217;t escape.

Your pants are filled with hot coals. Whether they got in your underwear naturally or supernaturally is never certain, you can&#8217;t tell because your mind is blank with pain. Your only remaining option is to chase this woman/man until you can have them for yourself. Once you snare them, the searing burning pain you feel in your crotch disappears. Ever wonder why that Prince in Cinderalla was so pissed off when she racked off leaving one shoe? The coals were burning buddy and he needed to find the owner of that shoe to make it end. Humans are purely in sexual relationships so they don&#8217;t have to put up with 6th degree burns to the bottom half of their body. Why else would you bother?
