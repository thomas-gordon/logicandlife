Slavery. What a disgusting, demorilising thing to be put though. <!--more-->Over the years countless humans have made sweat and poured it on themselves as a direct result of slavery. The dictators and garbage collectors of past generations have all told us what to do. As a matter of fact slavery was invented through direct interaction with the thumbgalics. These greasy, salty.. delicious.. chewy.. bastards had thumbs on their elbows. Direct war with humans had left them bitter and resentful and their numbers were dwindling. The humans hatched a powerful masterplot to force victory. First they captured the children then put a hard casing around them before handing them back to their parents while they were asleep. Their parents couldn&#8217;t open the casing because their thumbs were on their elbows. So the children couldn&#8217;t survive. More brutally soon the humans worked out a way to correct the DNA of the thumbgalics until their children were 

**born inside** the shells. The pain of the thumbgalics was offset by the humans relishing in their obvious and swift victory.

Over time the children would pass on and they would shrivel up, concentrating their delicious meat and salty flavour inside the shells. Today female thumbgalics are kept in government labs to give birth to these shells and their delicious offspring that reside within. Only those with posable thumbs can open the shells and taste the wonderous joy that is the pistachio.
