> *Pack up your things, we&#8217;re almost definitely never coming back. <!--more-->That was the thing that the post-apocalyptic husband said to his wife. So they got into their car, pulled the diaper off their baby&#8217;s ass and went down the street to the pawn brokers to try and trade the shit filled nappy into something they could use. Food, guns, girls, the list went on. As a matter of Â fact the husband had made a list but then had no toilet paper so had to use it on his own butt.*

While this story is more than likely a fabrication by Apple, intended to teach children that they should always write things down on their iPhones instead of using real paper, the meaning goes a whole lot deeper. One might say it goes perhaps into the depths of impossible sodomy. Let&#8217;s use paper as an example. You need a whole lot of paper in business. In fact you need trees for just about everything from dry biscuits to cardboard. Now as you buy more the companies realise the demand so make less. In fact this continues until the product stops production entirely. This is called the &#8220;economic bottleneck&#8221; and is the reason for our current state of recession.

People have the money, that&#8217;s not the problem. The fact is that they spent so much of it buying the same thing over and over until the companies had to realise they should stop producing and selling it entirely. Just the other day I really wanted a banana but I couldn&#8217;t find a shop with one stocking them. So I called the banana machine and he was all like &#8220;fuck off man I can&#8217;t make this anymore, the orders are all messed up in my head so I&#8217;m just chilling with my best buddies milk and yoghurt, milk is one horny bastard, he&#8217;s spraying everywhere!&#8221;

Here is a graph illustrating the issue:
