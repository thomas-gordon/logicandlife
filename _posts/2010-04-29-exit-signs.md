The exit sign what! <!--more-->Yes the exit sign is green. Green means go, safety, money and also grass. Or Marijuana. Now you read and think &#8220;well I can see where this is going&#8221;! Well I can assure you it IS going, and going to continue.

All buildings have exits. They have exits simply because they have entrances. Have you ever been through a door that you could exit but not enter or perhaps one that you can exit and enter despite it being intended as an entrance? Take the Eiffel Tower. There&#8217;s one door at the top because there isn&#8217;t room for anything else. The reason people jump off tall buildings like this it is that there&#8217;s no exit sign over the one door. How could one exit safely from a building not designated escapable? It&#8217;s a fair question and one I agree with and came up with.

At a university there are on average three entrances to a building and one &#8220;exit&#8221; door. Yet not only do people NEVER exit from it, they exit from the doors that you&#8217;re supposed to use as entrances? They wonder why the western world is so far disconnected from the humanity of existence. It&#8217;s because we&#8217;re taught to live in denial of real doors. You know like fucking solid wooden things that stand as a testament to our ingenuity. 

Exit signs tease us into a false sense of security. Odds are when someone actually *illegally(!)* tries to obey the command the door will be rusted shut from misuse! Remember that movie &#8220;titanic&#8221;? Yeah well exit signs are to me a lot like leonardo di caprio. Fat, balding and a giant nuisance in a short list of eye-sores that Eeyore couldn&#8217;t put up with. And that prick is a dirty mule!
