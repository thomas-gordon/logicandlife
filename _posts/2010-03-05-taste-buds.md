While standing in line for the bus I like to taste the people who are also standing there. <!--more-->There I said it, I&#8217;m one of &#8220;those&#8221; people that tries to absorb experience through the mouth.  You get some people who disagree with your whereabouts (if you&#8217;re near their crotch) but it&#8217;s all in good fun. Then you have people complaining when I go to the toilet in their garden after secretly licking their sweat off in their sleep. So what is the point of all this overboard extravaganzamanial behaviour in relation to my mouth? I&#8217;m a trained horticulturists and I think that taste buds are an inverse garden.

Where is man. Where is woman? Where are people? In the ground. Dying slowly or already at peace. Part of the world&#8217;s F5 of life. Then we go and eat flowers from the earth. Or we eat vegetables or goats. While it all seems all innocent in all likelyhood the reality is we&#8217;re eating from the earth where something has died, defacated or had copious sex. Is that really worse than me finding solace in tasting strangers&#8217; sweat? The taste buds were named so by Churchill because they have the potential to flower into something more, something more like a taste plant than just a simple bud. Underlying all of this is a crucial message in these uncertain eco-aware times.

It&#8217;s fairly simple. In order to stop the degradation of our existence which is spreading by consuming and destroying, all we need to do is surgically plant some trees in our buds in our mouth. In order for this to be actualised the energy requirement will be huge. What do trees grow best with? Shit on your feet and they&#8217;ll soak in the nutrients and make the trees grow bigger. Why be a tree-hugger when you can have one growing roots deep into your internal organs?
