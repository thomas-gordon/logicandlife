Accolades! What a great thing to be told you&#8217;re awesome. <!--more-->That you&#8217;ve done a good job. The way we live our life is based around getting encouraged in the right way as children. Self esteem, sex life, sado-masochism, blah blah. Then you get older and then you do your job and maybe something else happens, or maybe it doesn&#8217;t. When you die, you have brain surgery for the 

**S**outh **U**nified **C**entral **K**inetic **I**nterest **N**ando **G**rommet **O**rganisation **N**ecessitating **M**andatory **Y**early **T**esting **I**n **T**he **T**emporal **I**nner **I**nside **E**ucular **S**brain place.

They open your brain to see the damage these accolades have had on your system. The degradation your poor brain has suffered from being congratulated. You see as you age and get more successful, your brain weakens against the burning, almost flame-like light that travels through your eyes, the optic nerve and into the brain.

If you never had gotten a &#8220;well done&#8221; call, your brain would never have relaxed. It would have dealt against the light with a brain shield of ultimate resilience. Now you&#8217;re dead and you have a perfectly smooth, undamaged brain. It&#8217;s only when you get love, security and safety that the brain shield thinks it&#8217;s all ok, lets down the barrier and lets the flame of the sun into the vulnerable meat that is your delicious brain. This explanation also serves to describe why humans like rare meat. It&#8217;s our brains wishing they weren&#8217;t so cooked, wishing that you hadn&#8217;t lived such a comfortable, lazy existence.
