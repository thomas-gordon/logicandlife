Out in the backyard of my house birds often sit.<!--more--> They sit there and do nothing. I haven&#8217;t seen many birds that do nothing. These birds do. Now these THINGS, all plain and sitting do nothing for my imagination except spark utter contempt for the constantly thrown around phrase &#8220;bird of feather&#8221;. The dictionary says that this phrase means &#8220;birds that have feathers&#8221;. The grammatical stance on this phrase is bamboozlydoodle. I&#8217;ve never seen a naked bird. If there were naked birds they probably wouldn&#8217;t be birds, they&#8217;d be humans. We could indeed fly if we had feathers after all. So on a gross technicality I surmise that if we all are similar down to the fact of number of appendages matches most of our neighbours then we are all humans &#8220;humans of appendages&#8221;.

I&#8217;ve also looked at all of this from different angles, similar to a well used protractor. Some people say that birds of feather applies to things that are in the same physical space. I suppose they mean that many birds can share the same individual feathers. REALLY? even for me this seems farfetch&#8217;d. I mean I&#8217;ve seen birds flying about together but definitely not using the same feather. Bird**S** of **A** feather. How dangerous! Birds in the air having a flap and then tossing their flight giving feathers to other in their flock. As soon as one bird lost its feather it wouldn&#8217;t be able to fly so you&#8217;d get a bizarre mix of birds landing HARD on the ground and some managing to re catch their feathers for another flap just before crash landing.

I guess the moral of this story is that if you&#8217;re a bird and you feel like sharing get back to aerial regurgitation. This is far more entertaining and won&#8217;t hurt your brethren.
