There&#8217;s a strong correlation between emotion and humans. <!--more-->Other animals and things in the world don&#8217;t have emotion. If you look at a cat and it&#8217;s going through something that would be annoying to a human, odds are its brain is just hurting. It probably doesn&#8217;t know why. Love birds sit next to each other on branches so they can talk about sitting on branches. They have soft voices so they have to be right next to one another. Other things that look like emotion&#8230; for example dogs whining or &#8220;bitching&#8221; are just copied from looking at a superior being like a human and straining to burst out of the skin (evolve). Brain hurting being instinct just makes it so. I think emotion is largely tied down to one immutable, terrible fact. It takes nine months for a baby to be born. As a result of this arduous horseshit humans feel pain, loss, happiness and sadness all to ridiculous extremes that actually help nothing in the long run.
