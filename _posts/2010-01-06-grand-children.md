Some day you&#8217;ll grow old. <!--more-->Ancient in fact! You&#8217;ll get wrinkled, you&#8217;ll lose any concept of reality and you&#8217;ll drift into obscurity before you become dead. Either that or you just sell your body parts one by one until someone gives you $40 for your head. Hell at least you made a profit! The ancient lines will appear on your face as your body deteriorates towards death and quite probably hell. I mean let&#8217;s face it, most of us are going there. Sounds like you can&#8217;t eat meat in heaven anyway.

So you&#8217;re sitting in a home reflecting on your life. It&#8217;s been a long, boring road. A long boring road that leads to&#8230; this? Severe physical and emotional pain barely held back by the shitty little buckets of pills you have to eat every day! Awful. Then you think.. hang on, I&#8217;ve had kids! Now wait.. Those kids are too old.. Don&#8217;t they have grandkids?&#8230; Yes!

You call them and ask them for the one thing that you could possibly have in common with them. You ask them for hallucinogens. You ask for weed. Hell why not ask for heroin, if you&#8217;ll be dead in 6 months who cares anyway. This is the reason humans are genetically programmed to want to have kids, so later in life we can safely know that we&#8217;ll have a constant stream of illicit drugs. Imagine if you had 10 dealers just a phone call away, each willing to give you &#8220;mate&#8217;s rates&#8221;. Incredible. So yes, have children while you can. As many as you can. At least that way you&#8217;ll get to leave the nursing home, most likely in a flying chariot or a helicopter hat that has a V8 horsepower engine.
