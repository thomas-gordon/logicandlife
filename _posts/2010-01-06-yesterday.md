Whoops, is it midnight already? <!--more-->That sucks. I wanted to get more done in the day. Every day I wake up and realise that another day has dawned. Or an evening has passed and I&#8217;ve napped through the weekly Christmas festivities. Ok and calendars have these lines that divide up the days into pieces. I&#8217;m going to take you on a journey, of time travel and murk. What time is yesterday? One could posit that the question is based in a constant stream of time and has no one answer.

&#8220;don&#8217;t be stupid. yesterday is the day before today and that always changes&#8221;

Horse shit. Don&#8217;t get me started. Or do. Stick a key in my ass. Turn&#8230;. Ok I&#8217;m started. Took a while, it&#8217;s an cold morning. You turn on the radio and out of my mouth (which is the car&#8217;s speakers) comes a news announcement &#8220;Yesterday we announced that the day before had been rather cold and ugly. We got it wrong. Sorry!&#8221; Then another&#8230; &#8220;In other news, yesterday planes were over our heads, zooming past. Watch out today for a plausible re-occurrence of the event.&#8221;

How can supposedly excellent news services claim to provide a consistent service when their story of what Yesterday was changes so frequently. You can&#8217;t get history wrong. Have you ever heard a story recounted incorrectly or missing parts? I think not. There is no logic in yesterday except perhaps for the fact that it has occurred a limited amount of times. You don&#8217;t hear everyone talking about yesterday that often, and as long as it hasn&#8217;t been discussed then it doesn&#8217;t exist. So yesterday has roughly occurred 6 times. In order to back this up I want you to go and burn 11 months out of every calendar in the house. Then with the remaining month do this:
