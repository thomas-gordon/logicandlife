Walking very, very slowly into the kitchen from the front door leads to a few conclusions.<!--more-->First you notice the amount of dust in the air. Then you notice just how many things there are in your house. Then you notice that extension leads are kind of everywhere. In every sense of the word they seem to be extensively extensiony. WE&#8217;ve got a toaster that&#8217;s powered from a point in the roof, a heater that&#8217;s powered from the garage and all the rest of the everything in the house running off an illegally tapped wire across the road, the lead literally crossing the asphalt. I had to construct a 25 point powerboard. Isn&#8217;t this all kind of dangerous? I really do wonder why appliances don&#8217;t have long leads by default. What use is a 20cm long computer lead? If you&#8217;re lucky enough to have a power point in your room the lead is still struggling against the wall like some sort of weak human in a choke hold. My proposal is thus: We install a minimum of 8 powerpoints in each room. Following from that we have one 20 metre extension lead coming out of each point and then two 15 point power boards plugged into each one. This reduces the likelihood of injury, ride the lightning, electricution and mess.

I&#8217;ll show you a real world example of this. Think about your local abbatoir. I go and visit mine quite regularly. The cows get slaughtered etc etc. Anyway if there were more power points available the cow could be minced alive using more than one bar mixer at a time. You could set up a kind of trough in the floor to catch all the mince meat. I guess there is the added expense of giving the workers glasses but this is a reality that big business is probably willing to deal with. I would say that we&#8217;d have to deal with way less 2 star mince at the supermarket because it&#8217;ll be cheaper to create real mince meat. There is the other added benefit of having men around, you can just use their yellow cables if you can&#8217;t afford to buy all those leads. We&#8217;re hardly ever short of urine.
