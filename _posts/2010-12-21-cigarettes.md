Inside most 7-11 stores lies a whole collection of rolled tobacco. <!--more-->It&#8217;s there in waiting to be burnt up by fire. A cigarette 

*LOVES *being smoked. It loves being burnt up into smoke, swirling through the air like an impossible mango steam. Without meaning to sound callous, it is my personal belief that people who smoke are the new age of people. Think about it like this. Chimneys blow smoke out vertically, technically exerting force on the earth. Now this being the case, what ends up happening is that houses sink into the ground. It takes years and we may have slowed the process by inventing concrete but all in all a home fire is a waste of energeegeey. Cigarette smokers put the fire in their mouth *horizontally*. This means if they wanted they could run backwards very quickly. There are many other applications for this that inadvertantly occur. When people stand on trains and smoke have you noticed that the train goes faster? This is why we banter around the phrase &#8220;off in a puff of smoke&#8221;.

Then there&#8217;s sex. I&#8217;ve heard that people who smoke love cigarettes afterwards. One can only assume that the word cigarette is *rooted* in this dialect. Why? Because cigarettes are &#8220;secret eggs&#8221;. They further the odds of successful reproduction; &#8220;Oh Jerry, let&#8217;s have a secret egg after that!!!&#8221; What Celina is telling Jerry is that in order to relax properly they should both smoke and each puff will release another egg into the sexual aftermath. These eggs are secret and covert ops. So they&#8217;re really good at finding semen. Essentially what this is all equating to is that cigarettes aren&#8217;t good for you, they&#8217;re good for *other people. *This is notably a fact never argued in the public media, never discussed. This is because without cigarettes we&#8217;d never die. Everyone would live forever and no one would have children because there would be no secret eggs doing the dirty work for y&#8217;all.
