So many people travel overseas! <!--more-->They take planes and go to the other country. There&#8217;s Australia, and then there. I&#8217;m always hearing people rave about it but the last time I went it was not all peaches and curds. I waited for my luggage at the cartel thingy with all the other foreigners for about an hour and nothing came out. We were hearing muffled gun shots through the wall but we didn&#8217;t see any people dead or blood anywhere and there was no announcement. Eventually most people left, angry that they&#8217;d have to stay there without their bags. The attendants just shrugged and ate bugs.

I wouldn&#8217;t accept it so I strapped on my machete and cut my way to the back of the building. There I saw it. A very large cannon with a screen and keypad on the left of it. I hacked in and found it was some kind of missile targeting system. I heard a giant lizard coming out of the jungle so I hid in quicksand, a move I would later regret. The lizard was carrying a whole stack of bags, with luggage tags reflecting in the moonlight.

He loaded them into the cannon and targeted random locations in the city and fired. The luggage made a large sound like a gun. I hacked off my head with his machete and stuck myself in the cannon, launching myself into the city. I picked up my bag and went on my way. So if you are going to travel, pack a sawn off shotgun and a whole stack of drugs up your ass because the only reason anyone travels is to have greater access to narcotics.
