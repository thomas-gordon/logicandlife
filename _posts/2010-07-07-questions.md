I ask a lot of questions. <!--more-->A lot of them are inane. Some of them are worth your time but odds are most are most definitely not. So sometimes someone will ask me a question about why I ask them dumb things like &#8220;what if you woke up and the milk bottle in your fridge had changed into a very large version of the popular street sweet &#8220;milk bottles&#8221;Â &#8221; Fairly seriously this would likely result in anger and confusion. But these questions that I ask always have the answer of &#8220;that wouldn&#8217;t happen&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you bother&#8221;.

I&#8217;ve been learning that if you don&#8217;t take a lighter, perverse logic to the elements then there is actually very little to write home about. If you did write home it would go something like this: &#8220;Hey dad and mum, yesterday I made some coffee and stayed at work about 5 minutes longer than I normally do!&#8221; There is no question inside this statement. There is a blank, boring room with a shitty windows computer vomiting words out onto 95% recycled paper in a chair that you&#8217;re mostly uncomfortable in because some part of you thinks the floor is slanty.

There is no room for expansion or the moving from one thing to another. The conversation will inevitably lead to normal life and why it sucks because the thing that most people have in common is the shit that we all &#8216;wallow&#8217; in. Because of our stupid brains everything is relative so telling people about it hardly helps, it just brings the entire mood down of any social situation. So really I believe a lot of happiness is down to asking questions that result in impossible answers. That&#8217;s kind of what this blog is about. I *could* sit there on the same bus route I&#8217;ve been on 2000 times and sink into my chair in a fit of depression and solitude, considering each day similar to the last. Or I could combine the elements of the mundane with other elements of the mundane, resize them, make them talk, change their orientation or language and then wonder how they would react to being put in EXACTLY the position they are in once again. So sure deride and negate my input as childish or immature but in the end I&#8217;ll be the dude with straight pants wondering whether a sledgehammer that is too light is considered a pacifist and you&#8217;ll just think you need a better one and discard the light one like the daily skin follicles you breathe as the dust of wasted brain space.
