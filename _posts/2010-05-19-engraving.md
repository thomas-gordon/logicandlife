I just recently made the leap into iphone-dom. <!--more-->By that I mean I got anally raped by an iphone. Get it? Domination. Well I would have gotten away with it too if it hadn&#8217;t been for pesky engraving. Buying something and scratching your name on it doesn&#8217;t really make that product yours at all. What it does do is stack up like a big ol&#8217; bale of hay. So to continue with that metaphor: I buy an apple. On the side of that apple I engrave my name because I want to eat it later. The problem is that by cutting into the apple I expose it and it goes brown and very quickly mouldy. It doesn&#8217;t help that we keep all of our fruit inside the toilet (there&#8217;s no room anywhere else)

So like a bale of hay that&#8217;s left in a shed for too long engraving can spontaneously combust. Think of it on a double time metaphor of a lava flow river. If you don&#8217;t engrave your shit then lava will flow straight over the surface, not harming anything. As soon as you do the lava gets stuck and burns a hole through your thing that you wanted to be yours so badly. Also if lava was allowed to flow anywhere near hay there would be no need for spontaneous combustion at all!

While the riddles and lines of this post may be occasionally unclear it is clear to me that unless what you&#8217;re engraving is a lava proof rock that eats more hay than a cow eats grass then don&#8217;t engrave your shit. Just don&#8217;t. You&#8217;re more likely to get it stolen and pawned, you&#8217;re more likely to be laughed at by the new owner of the thing and you&#8217;re definitely more likely to have to buy another one because when your nearest volcano erupts it&#8217;ll get destroyed. You don&#8217;t see me cutting my name in my arm to mark myself as belonging to myself.. so why do it on other stuff?
