I find it fascinating that birthdays are near Mother&#8217;s Day.<!--more--> Just sayin&#8217;. Anyway so what are we celebrating here? I have an odd theory about babies. I think it&#8217;s 100% true. So your dad knocks up your mum. They have sex. Probably a lot of unprotected sex. Then your mum goes through a long period of uteral gestation while you grow and physically stretch her skin irrevocably and cause her to be controlled by hormonal desires that most would deem irrational. I mean imagine if you were a cat in the house and your mum was all eating all of its food? Shit. So then there&#8217;s a period of extreme trauma on your birthday. As in severe pain. Danger.

A woman may be at her most vulnerable in this situation, if you wanted to run away it&#8217;d be pretty freaking hard. So overall one could liken the experience to being tortured in a war. So. You come out of there and instead of thanking your mother for holding you in there you cry and moan and demand MORE. Milk, attention&#8230; you&#8217;re the boss.

So what does this mean? Your existence.. indeed your whole life is an abhorration, a trauma. Your mother loves you because if she didn&#8217;t she&#8217;d break down and go into the foetal position. So your birth is celebrated rather than hated. Sure that may seem negative but who doesn&#8217;t like placenta cake?
