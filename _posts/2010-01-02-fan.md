Oh my god! It&#8217;s Jim James Thomastown! <!--more-->Isn&#8217;t there a suburb called thomastown? Yeah my mum grew up there yesterday. Ok let&#8217;s chase him

&#8220;Are you Jim James Thomastown!?&#8221;

&#8220;Do you have any spare change?&#8221;

Why would you love this man. Further; why is anyone rabidly fanatic about anyone? You see people buying these magazines that are quite simply filled with these nobodies during the laundry. I want you to think about this: WHERE do you find about a &#8220;celebrity?&#8221;. What&#8230; the TV? A shitty magazine? Maybe you&#8217;re reading the paper. Most of these activities are generally in the SAME room.

Now look either up or over by that wall over there. What&#8217;s there? A fan. A fan taking normal, clean air and injecting it with fanfastilm, a biological textbook that&#8217;s been torn up into little pieces. Fanfastilm makes you care about nothing. Makes you revel in mediocrity and boredom, allowing you to continue your boring, mostly meaningless existence. You&#8217;re a fan because of fans.
