The fountain of youth. <!--more-->The Holy Grail, the end of all of the parts. What is it? Is it a liquid? No. Is it some kind of edible beverage? Closer. Think larger. You were once a child. Maybe you are a child right now. Aren&#8217;t kids cute? I hate children. That&#8217;s why we all grow up in the end. We can finally shed the shell that is childhood and get something useful done with our lives. Child-like innocence? Give me a kick in the face instead. Or my kid. Choose wisely! So people are always going on about this elixir that can help you from getting older. There have been dozens of movies about it. &#8220;Big&#8221;, &#8220;Casper&#8221;, &#8220;Jurassic Park&#8221; to name a few. Hell Darth Vader could have used some life-giving elixir, then maybe his face wouldn&#8217;t have been so messed up.

Turns out the stupid potion is right in front of our faces. Or it has been for some time. Let&#8217;s have a closer look at the child to find out. Closer.. closer&#8230; ok now you&#8217;re a pervert because you&#8217;re nuzzled next to a women lactating profusely into her baby&#8217;s mouth. Ever seen an adult drink breast milk? Maybe you&#8217;d try it if your wife or husband was pregnant. But drink it all day? I think not.

The thing is while breast milk does keep you locked at a certain age it has a lot of nasty effects. It makes you not have much hair and barely be able to walk and totally, udderly reliant on your parents. Luckily cows milk has the opposite effect. It makes you age, disconnect from your parents and you can walk competently (probably). Ever seen those movies where old people look at cows and then later in the film they die peacefully? It&#8217;s all a metaphor. Now eat your 3 serves of dairy a day.
