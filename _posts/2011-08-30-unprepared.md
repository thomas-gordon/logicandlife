As I recently got hacked (I&#8217;m still giddy with excitement about that one!) I have decided to prepare a manual about unpreparing, or &#8220;being unprepared&#8221; for all of you orwellian purists. It is the nature of the psyche to become more aware about something after it has happened to you. If you are waiting for the bus you are unprepared for its arrival. You can guess where to stand but odds are all the other school kids will end up laughing at your stupid face as the bus pulls up 3 metres away from where you&#8217;re standing. You can pretend that you were staring at your phone or thinking so hard that you couldn&#8217;t walk but let&#8217;s face it Joe, you **fucked up. **

Being physically wrong is quite interesting. The sensation of something happening around you which is completely different to what you had extraneously spacially envisaged. You know, when you&#8217;re waiting for a cab at what you think is the cab rank and then two cabs pull up 20 metres down the road. &#8220;What if those people who got in the cab thought I was stupid for waiting in the wrong place! Better chase them and tell them that I make code on websites and I can do push ups inside my MIND!&#8221; You get a hot flush and you glance around to make sure you aren&#8217;t calling attention to yourself. Of course by glancing around in an empty street you are doing exactly that.

So aside from spacial preparation there is also work preparation. You get up to go to work with only your underwear on. You are eating your beard for breakfast. You are asking everyone to never tell you the time. You are *unprepared* for work. At least that&#8217;s what your dismissal form will say. They way to avoid this is to make a list of all the things you don&#8217;t have to do before work. That way you&#8217;ll weed it down to the things you do need to do. Efficient and a good use of 25 pages of paper.

There is also sexual unpreparedness. Ok you ladies all know about this one! &#8220;Jerry have you forgotten what sex is again?!&#8221;. Men forget things. I know! I&#8217;m not a man! Men need guides on the best of days. Most days aren&#8217;t the best. Only one is the best. So on most days it helps men if the lady straps a large plastic sheet to the entire body of her male, leaving hole only for the erection. This avoids the problem that men come across; that they mix up arms with penises.  Now using the handles on the corners of the plastic sheet the lady simply has to position the man and we&#8217;re underway! Being prepared can save you from anything except an unexpected lady with a penis. Even then you can go for the early grope but that can end badly.
