Both of your hands have something wrong with them. <!--more-->Something that is against the human genome. Traced back to apes, the clear bits of glass on the ends of your fingers have a story of misery and woe with an a-typical moral lesson. Jim, an ape with too much time and a selfish, vain streak, was bored. There were no mirrors around and he liked to look at himself constantly. Eating a banana, Climbing a tree, whatever it was Jim wanted to see himself doing it. Jim made some glass from a dilapidated cabinet and stabbed a shard into the ends of all of his fingers. Now he could watch himself doing whatever he wanted. After a time the glass fused with his genome and began to grow.

The pain was excruciating, each day the glass would form inside his finger and slice its way to the surface. Jim could do nothing to remove the pain except chew away, cutting up his mouth as well. Over the years the glass stayed in the evolution stream, a reminder to the human race not to be vain. We learnt to cope with the pain but only up to a point. Ever been at your weakest point and felt a pain that seems to take over your mind? The pain of your fingerglass cutting through has surfaced. We are the only things on this planet that feel pain because we&#8217;re the only ones that care too much about our appearance.
