Dating is an interesting thing. It&#8217;s a big game of cats and saucers of milk. <!--more-->Eventually one of the cats ends up drinking from the saucer of milk and is freaking loving that shit, slurping it all up as fast as possible. and it lasts until there&#8217;s no milk left and the cat gets pissed off and fucks off. Then the whole thing repeats over and over until the cat settles with a saucer that has no milk.

Go figure. How does the cat get the milk in the first place? It is pretty safe to say that in cities a LOT of people meet in clubs. Somehow people hook up, get together, leave and go and drink each other&#8217;s milk somewhere else. This is achieved by a slick physical display that lures the intended target into your arms. First you play hard to get. You buy the opposite person a drink then (this bit is never shown in movies for some reason) you smash the drink in the other person&#8217;s face. You stomp on their feet and yell over the music that you don&#8217;t like the hat they&#8217;re wearing.

&#8220;IT&#8217;S OUT OF PLACE AND WHY ARE YOU WEARING A HAT ANYWAY&#8221;

The person you&#8217;re after is now pissed off. What do you do? Simple. Bend down like you&#8217;re going to tie your shoe. Tie your wrists to your shoes so you can&#8217;t stand up any more:

</p>

Now jump around the club in this position until you get spanked thoroughly on the ass. Untie your wrists and it&#8217;s probably the person you were so obviously mean to. Simple rules of attraction. Fend&#8217;em off and then while you&#8217;re bended over you&#8217;ll win em back. Fender Bender.
