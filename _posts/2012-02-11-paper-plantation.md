The environmental degradation of the planet is seemingly never ending. The newspaper is constantly going on about how every action has a negative consequence on everything green. Never mind that green is the universally accepted colour of &#8220;bile&#8221; or &#8220;illness&#8221;, we can&#8217;t seem to stop trying to make as many green things exist or continue to exist. Recycling is seen as a way to curb our never-ending destructive ways yet for most the irony is lost.

Paper is collected in green bins made of negative environmental atoms and this paper is planted in the ground for trees to come and eat it. Recycled paper is actually awful and brown so how do they get it as white as normally harvested fresh paper? The underside of killer whales is grated off (using the zest side of your average kitchen grater) for the purest white to colour the best office reams. Is *that* good for the environment?

In Tasmania the trees aren&#8217;t getting the food they need. Instead due to little sun or any form of stimulating activity or culture they&#8217;re all sleeping on the ground as they haven&#8217;t the energy to forage for paper to eat. Trucks pick them up, mistaking them for dead trees which can obviously be turned into fodder for living trees. This cyclical destruction of the wilderness isn&#8217;t helped by Tasmanian literacy levels which are at an all time low this year. If the trees news that newspaper was paper then they could eat that! Unfortunately by the time a tree has enough branches for the alphabet they&#8217;re mistaken for asleep and ground into a fine paper paste.

Government regulation isn&#8217;t helping the trees either. We aren&#8217;t allowed to throw paper all over the street. That&#8217;s called &#8220;littering&#8221; yet this goes against exactly what trees require so they die. A tree that&#8217;s left for too long ends up dissolving into concrete or asphalt and that&#8217;s how we come to the concrete jungle everyone has to live through today.
