Go on, get up out of your seat. Can you still read the computer screen? <!--more-->Well you definitely can. Why? I stuck you to your chair with glue. Suck it down. In fact if you want to talk more you should take the glue out of your mouth. Why? I filled your mouth with glue while you were asleep. What&#8217;s that? You want me to get rid of the glue? I don&#8217;t have anything in my bag except more glue, some of which i coated the keyboard in. Ah! Can&#8217;t type now! That glue is called &#8220;stucktillyarat&#8221;. Why is it called such a silly and probably made up word? Because you will be there, stuck in that chair until you go and rat on me to the police. Too bad your mouth is filled with glue. 

That was a long winded quote. And I don&#8217;t mean it was a strong gust of air from the upper highlands! I mean quite simply it went on for some time. Would it stand up in court? Yes. If the assailant was the glue itself as opposed to me you could sue it for $45 glue dollars. How much glue is a dollar? 45.
