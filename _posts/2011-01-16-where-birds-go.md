Night falls and the birds all around the world disappear. There are still birds, but it seems like they&#8217;re gone. <!--more-->The tones of their shrill cries are replaced by owls, who aren&#8217;t real birds owing to the fact that they can only fly under immense pressure from work for a promotion. As hard as they try, no one really trusts auntie flaps to deliver do they. Can&#8217;t hack the pressure so they take off like coopy ghosts. Aside from owls, the rest of the birds are gone. One thing we can be sure of is that they go one of two fairly unlikely places. Options for hereditary bird hiding are limited. It doesn&#8217;t really make sense that all birds die every day and turn to ash and then are reborn in the sunlight, there&#8217;s only one that can do that; Sir Phoenix! So it must follow that they go somewhere where they can&#8217;t be seen. The trick to this is despite 

*owning* a torch, I haven&#8217;t the feintist idea why the battery doesn&#8217;t help illuminate the incendiary notion of capitulation to a proported case of cheese, untouched by the ideals of the bird kingdom.

So birds are in one of two places. The first is that they&#8217;ve become &#8220;bird trees&#8221;, planting themselves into the ground with their beak driven hard into the soil. This would make sense as at night you are more likely to hear loud brushing sounds of the &#8220;trees&#8221;. Why doesn&#8217;t this sound occur so violently during the day? Basically all of the birds are ass-up in some deep dirt right there. The brushing noise is them rubbing up against each other. Sounds sexual, isn&#8217;t. That said if you had a bird fetish the place to deal with it would be at night, hunting for vulnerable ass-birds.

Lastly but moist certainly not leastly there&#8217;s the very, very high chance that the beak is used for digging. At night all of the birds sleep in a big cave in your backyard. Vomiting on each other for warmth and sustenance, they emerge from the bird slum to a brand new day covered in piss, vomit, bird shit and are hence angry. The early bird isn&#8217;t squawking because it&#8217;s happy, it&#8217;s squawking from post-traumatic stress disorder.
