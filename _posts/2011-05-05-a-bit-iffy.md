It is unlikely that your life is actually *that* bad. It might seem that way but uhm it isn&#8217;t. If you can read this, it isn&#8217;t as bad as you think. If you have a computer it&#8217;s not even bad. At least you aren&#8217;t a rubbish bin, forced to love all garbage unconditionally. So the whole notion of being unsettled has recently been in my head quite a bit until a person told me that I was &#8220;a bit iffy&#8221;.<!--more-->

I took this to mean (obviously) that i presented myself with an overwhelming air of possibility. The phrase is innately  complimentary isn&#8217;t it? I mean if I am &#8220;of if&#8221;, as in &#8220;having if&#8221; in me a lot&#8230; doesn&#8217;t that mean that I have no core dependency or subject to fall back on other than myself? This means that I have the innate potential, nay, ability to have absolutely anything or to oppose this positivity I can absolutely refuse to do something simply based on the fact that I am myself.

That some people think the word &#8220;iffy&#8221; means unsettled, as if to say that there is no pre-requisite for &#8220;if&#8221; about you, meaning that you are meaningless (not just weird) just doesn&#8217;t quite sit right with me. Most of the time we call food iffy! How is it that food deserves such accolades. Especially food that is spoilt! Spoilt with mould!

&#8220;n&#8217;aww it&#8217;s a bit fuckin&#8217; iffy maate, chuck it on the barbie or out the pad-dock orright&#8221;?

What looks wrong with that sentence! How is a speaker such as this delivering such insight into human psychology and its relation to food? To me this reads as:

&#8220;Goodness friend, I think the mould has fallen in love with the food and they have decided they are each to their own a basis for logic! How is such a presumption possible without sentience! Maybe we should allow them to be thrown into the heat of passion of the hot plate or to be with their other semi-sentient beings (cows) out there in the fields of wild emotion and nullified regret!&#8221;
