I recently received a pebble watch after allowing myself to purchase one via kickstarter ages ago. A pebble watch is a &#8216;smart&#8217;-watch, meaning that it can connect with your phone to display notifications and inform you of the things that phones can&#8217;t. The watch itself is round, with gritty edges to sharpen knives on. Apparently it won&#8217;t implode even down to 50 metres beneath the earth&#8217;s crust but given it&#8217;s a rock I assume it&#8217;d probably be fine if you wanted to take it on an oil drill expedition or similar.

After opening the pebble box you are instantly faced with the watch and long black cable that you can plug into the watch via the computer. This allows some of the smarts of the watch to power the computer if your computer is either broken or a PC. You can discard this cable entirely into a waste disposal area if you have a mac. When the watch is removed from the packaging it needs to be sprayed with water every hour or so to keep it from drying out. If the watch dries out, the hands will go all crispy and fall off like pork crackling into my mouth.

One of the advantages of having a smart watch is that you can have a regular conversation with it and get answers to questions like &#8220;What is the time?&#8221; and &#8220;Where is the time?&#8221;. You might ask the latter because from this wristrockth you can control the music that sprays out of your phone. While you are doing this there is a tiny clock up the top of the screen but it&#8217;s just more convenient to use your phone to tell the time.

So why should you buy one? Here&#8217;s a plain list of pros and cons:

Pros:

  * Easy to read the time.
  * Comes in different sizes; pebble, rock, boulder.
  * All the buttons on the watch do the same thing.
  * The watch strap is made of sand.
  * Flicking your wrist stops the watch from vibrating non stop and therefore saves battery.
  * It&#8217;s easier to pick up other watches while you&#8217;re wearing it. This is due to the watch magnet inside the core of the technology and is something entirely new.
  * If you&#8217;re a geologist it&#8217;s just makes sense.

Cons:

  * Has a backlight.
  * The watch is gravity powered and needs to be dropped from high places to keep it going. Unless you live in a tall building and have friends to catch it when it hits the ground, this will be a problem.
  * People think you look lost if you wear it in public.
