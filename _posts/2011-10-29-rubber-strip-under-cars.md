Travelling in a car is all about creating and maintaining a proper sense of balance. Cars tip over more frequently than people so it&#8217;s kind of essential. When you get into the vehicle it&#8217;s important that you plant two feet firmly in place so your butt doesn&#8217;t fall out of the window. You have to fight the immense force of the car&#8217;s lean at all times which is why cars have passenger seats instead of just lining everyone up like in a fighter jet (Aeroplanes have an innate sense of balance, they never trip over neither!).

Once inside the vehicle the driver has to direct the ballast inside the car either left or right via a gear stick.  If the gears aren&#8217;t changed enough the car leans and veers one way or the other but you generally don&#8217;t notice this as it can be fought through the use of the steering Wheel©. The clutch is the final part of a balanced driving experience. It is named so because by pressing it the two out of balance halves of the car are tightened, each pressing towards the centre and therefore towards balance. Basically by using the clutch in tandem with the gear stick and making minor adjustments with the steering wheel you can generally manage to get the car from one place to another without falling out of it.

About twenty years ago Mr Holden Ford invented the final piece of the balance puzzle. He was sitting inside some beans and was thinking &#8220;why is it that we alone must drive? Why can&#8217;t driving be done by others?&#8221;. As there were no computers or electricity back then the idea didn&#8217;t have many places it could go. Then as Ford was a Christian he looked in the bible for references to balance and help. There was the ark with its ramp.

So Ford attached a small rubber ramp to the bottom of his car, one that wouldn&#8217;t get ruined by the speed of the vehicle. Knowing that car parks were generally near actual parks Ford made the logical assumption that tiny insects would get aboard in twos and help with the whole car balance issue. This lead to an effect that was many fold! The bugs innately redistributed the weight of the car by efficiently moving the bits of the undercar and the ballast around in real time as the driver drove. So the next time you&#8217;re laughing at that strip that hangs off the back of cars maybe just stop and thank all the bugs for allowing you to drive without holding on!
