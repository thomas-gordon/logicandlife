So dealing with individual suburbs is difficult. If you have to define a place, how do you describe it without hours and hours of research? <!--more-->Go to the library and read. Read books until you can&#8217;t read any more. Then drink some coffee and continue to read. Here&#8217;s how you find the best results:

1. Grab any book off the shelf.  
2. Go to the glossary and find &#8220;dromana&#8221;.  
3. Write out the definition on this website.

Here are some examples I found after looking for only 5 minutes.

*Dromana:* Casey was a young girl in tennesee and she had a DROll MAN As a husband.  
*Dromana:* Dromana is the term used by** Cloghall**, the drunk bird, in describing what he&#8217;ll be in a future life.  
*Dromana:* In 1920 Dromana was a term used in opposition to the Promana movement, rejecting daily scans for lack of earsight.  
*Dromana:* &#8220;Dro&#8217; man, wassup?&#8221;  
*Dromana:* Books have two types of things within them, pages and dromanes. The plural of Dromanes is Dromana.  
*Dromana:* Dromana is the word people use when they&#8217;re beating someone up and want to absolve themselves of any legal responsibility (forget to say it and you can legally be arrested). An example:

Man to Man #2: &#8220;**I&#8217;ll smash your face in**! Dromana! You need a lesson from Mr. and Mrs. Fist! Dromana!&#8221;  
Man #2: &#8220;Ow! Ow! Oh god!&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;  
Cop (standing and watching): &#8220;Well this all seems fine, move along and cut his leg off over there but so help me I&#8217;ll lock you up if you forget your sentancely dromanas!&#8221;
