Beans are fascinating things. <!--more--> Sometimes beans are one type of beans and sometimes another type of bean precludes the ability of that bean to be in existence. For example the wonderous coffee bean. Grind it up, pour the grounds into a cup of hot water and you&#8217;ll get a tasty, gritty beverage that&#8217;ll irritate you AND keep you awake. There isn&#8217;t any other way of drinking it so why not get started?
