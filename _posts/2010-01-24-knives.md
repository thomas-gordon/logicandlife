Homophobia. <!--more-->Prevalent in the majority of western society, it&#8217;s something that most people have to either deal with or buy the car. The salesman is good but maybe he&#8217;s not as good as you&#8217;d hope. Greasy cars, greasy car salesmen. There is a reason! Go into your kitchen and unsheath the biggest knives you can find. Lay them all out on the table. Can you use more than one of the knives at once? If you can&#8217;t, then you&#8217;d be the average Joe or Michelle. Jesus. You didn&#8217;t get lucky with that name! Get your parents to change it by going back in time or just change it yourself by crossing out your old one on the front cover of this book.

Knives didn&#8217;t use to be so sharp. They used to be soft, squishy friends who hung out together without any worries of injury or loss. Then one day there was a knife.. let&#8217;s call it&#8230;. Spoon. Spoon wanted knives in a way that was far too sexual and to be honest&#8230; it was queer. So the knives sharpened themselves to the point of fear. They also disconnected themselves from each other.

They figured as long as they were dangerous there was no chance that one would turn into a spoon and turn against them. If you can cut food with more than one knife watch what happens to the blade. It goes flaccid, scared of the possibility that a spoon might arise. So do we want an end to homophobia? either grow more arms to increase the proximity of one knife to another or just throw out ALL of the knives that you own.
